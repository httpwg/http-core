## HTTP/1.1 drafts editing arena (work in progress)

This is the working area for the [IETF HTTP Working Group](https://httpwg.github.io/)'s documents that define the HTTP protocol; see also our [extensions repository](https://github.com/httpwg/http-extensions/). See [our contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for information about how to participate.

**Be aware that all contributions to our work fall under the "NOTE WELL" terms therein.**

The [building instructions](BUILDING.txt) explain how to build the drafts from source.
