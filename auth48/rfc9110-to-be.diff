+a) References in tables: many tables list only the section number.  We
+will update to include the document as well (even though it is a
+reference within this document) for clarity and to match the style of
+other RFCs.
+
+We have also updated the column heading "Changes" in Table 1 for
+similar reasons (i.e., at first glance a reader might think Appendix
+B.1 of RFC 2818 is what is being changed).  HTML/PDF versions with
+links would not be unclear, but the text version may be.  Please let
+us know any objections.

+match the column headings in the corresponding registries.  Might it
+be helpful to the reader if they did?
+
+b) We see that the "Notes" column listed in the IANA registries (see
+below) is not mentioned in Sections 16.5.1 and 16.6.1.  At first, we
+assumed this intentional as it would not be a "MUST".  However, we see
