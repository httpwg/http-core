+<!--[rfced] Tables: We had the following questions related to tables
+     throughout the document.
+
+a) References in tables: many tables list only the section number.  We
+will update to include the document as well (even though it is a
+reference within this document) for clarity and to match the style of
+other RFCs.
+
+We have also updated the column heading "Changes" in Table 1 for
+similar reasons (i.e., at first glance a reader might think Appendix
+B.1 of RFC 2818 is what is being changed).  HTML/PDF versions with
+links would not be unclear, but the text version may be.  Please let
+us know any objections.
+
+b) Table 7 uses the column heading "Method" while the corresponding registry uses "Method Name".  May we update to the latter for consistency?
+
+c) Would you like the tables throughout to have titles?

+
+   cache-control / Cache-Control (2 instances, this term is capped in [CACHING])
