-Appendix C.  Change Log
-
-   This section is to be removed before publishing as an RFC.
-
-C.1.  Between RFC723x and draft 00
-
-   The changes were purely editorial:
-
-   *  Change boilerplate and abstract to indicate the "draft" status,
-      and update references to ancestor specifications.
-
-   *  Remove version "1.1" from document title, indicating that this
-      specification applies to all HTTP versions.
-
-   *  Adjust historical notes.
-
-   *  Update links to sibling specifications.
-
-   *  Replace sections listing changes from RFC 2616 by new empty
-      sections referring to RFC 723x.
-
-   *  Remove acknowledgements specific to RFC 723x.
-
-   *  Move "Acknowledgements" to the very end and make them unnumbered.
-
-C.2.  Since draft-ietf-httpbis-semantics-00
-
-   The changes in this draft are editorial, with respect to HTTP as a
-   whole, to merge core HTTP semantics into this document:
-
-   *  Merged introduction, architecture, conformance, and ABNF
-      extensions from RFC 7230 (Messaging).
-
-   *  Rearranged architecture to extract conformance, http(s) schemes,
-      and protocol versioning into a separate major section.
-
-   *  Moved discussion of MIME differences to [HTTP/1.1] since that is
-      primarily concerned with transforming 1.1 messages.
-
-   *  Merged entire content of RFC 7232 (Conditional Requests).
-
-   *  Merged entire content of RFC 7233 (Range Requests).
-
-   *  Merged entire content of RFC 7235 (Auth Framework).
-
-   *  Moved all extensibility tips, registration procedures, and
-      registry tables from the IANA considerations to normative
-      sections, reducing the IANA considerations to just instructions
-      that will be removed prior to publication as an RFC.

-
-   *  Changed to using "payload" when defining requirements about the

-      server, remove "none" from the ABNF because it is now a reserved
-      range unit, and allow the field to be sent in a trailer section
