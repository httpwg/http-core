   The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level
   protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information
   systems. It is a generic, stateless, protocol which can be used for
   many tasks beyond its use for hypertext, such as name servers and
   distributed object management systems, through extension of its
   request methods, error codes and headers <xref target="RFC2324"/>. A feature of HTTP is
   the typing and negotiation of data representation, allowing systems
   to be built independently of the data being transferred.
</t>
<t>
   HTTP has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information
   initiative since 1990. This specification defines the protocol
   referred to as "HTTP/1.1", and is an update to RFC 2068 <xref target="RFC2068"/>.

<section title="Purpose" anchor="intro.purpose">
<t>
   The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level
   protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information
   systems. HTTP has been in use by the World-Wide Web global
   information initiative since 1990. The first version of HTTP,
   referred to as HTTP/0.9, was a simple protocol for raw data transfer
   across the Internet. HTTP/1.0, as defined by RFC 1945 <xref target="RFC1945"/>, improved
   the protocol by allowing messages to be in the format of MIME-like
   messages, containing metainformation about the data transferred and
   modifiers on the request/response semantics. However, HTTP/1.0 does
   not sufficiently take into consideration the effects of hierarchical
   proxies, caching, the need for persistent connections, or virtual
   hosts. In addition, the proliferation of incompletely-implemented
   applications calling themselves "HTTP/1.0" has necessitated a
   protocol version change in order for two communicating applications
   to determine each other's true capabilities.
</t>
<t>
   This specification defines the protocol referred to as "HTTP/1.1".
   This protocol includes more stringent requirements than HTTP/1.0 in
   order to ensure reliable implementation of its features.
</t>
<t>
   Practical information systems require more functionality than simple
   retrieval, including search, front-end update, and annotation. HTTP
   allows an open-ended set of methods and headers that indicate the
   purpose of a request <xref target="RFC2324"/>. It builds on the discipline of reference
   provided by the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) <xref target="RFC1630"/>, as a location
   (URL) <xref target="RFC1738"/> or name (URN) <xref target="RFC1737"/>, for indicating the resource to which a
   method is to be applied. Messages are passed in a format similar to
   that used by Internet mail <xref target="RFC822"/> as defined by the Multipurpose
   Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) <xref target="RFC2045"/>.
</t>
<t>
   HTTP is also used as a generic protocol for communication between
   user agents and proxies/gateways to other Internet systems, including
   those supported by the SMTP <xref target="RFC821"/>, NNTP <xref target="RFC977"/>, FTP <xref target="RFC959"/>, Gopher <xref target="RFC1436"/>,
   and WAIS <xref target="WAIS"/> protocols. In this way, HTTP allows basic hypermedia
   access to resources available from diverse applications.
</t>

<section title="Requirements" anchor="intro.requirements">
<t>
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
</t>
<t>
   An implementation is not compliant if it fails to satisfy one or more
   of the &MUST; or &REQUIRED; level requirements for the protocols it
   implements. An implementation that satisfies all the &MUST; or &REQUIRED;
   level and all the &SHOULD; level requirements for its protocols is said
   to be "unconditionally compliant"; one that satisfies all the &MUST;
   level requirements but not all the &SHOULD; level requirements for its
   protocols is said to be "conditionally compliant."

</t>
<t>
  <iref item="resource"/>
  <x:dfn>resource</x:dfn>
  <list>
    <t>
      A network data object or service that can be identified by a URI,
      as defined in <xref target="uri"/>. Resources may be available in multiple
      representations (e.g. multiple languages, data formats, size, and
      resolutions) or vary in other ways.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
  <iref item="entity"/>
  <x:dfn>entity</x:dfn>
  <list>
    <t>
      The information transferred as the payload of a request or
      response. An entity consists of metainformation in the form of
      entity-header fields and content in the form of an entity-body, as
      described in <xref target="entity"/>.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
  <iref item="representation"/>
  <x:dfn>representation</x:dfn>
  <list>
    <t>
      An entity included with a response that is subject to content
      negotiation, as described in <xref target="content.negotiation"/>. There may exist multiple
      representations associated with a particular response status.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
  <iref item="content negotiation"/>
  <x:dfn>content negotiation</x:dfn>
  <list>
    <t>
      The mechanism for selecting the appropriate representation when
      servicing a request, as described in <xref target="content.negotiation"/>. The
      representation of entities in any response can be negotiated
      (including error responses).

  </list>
</t>
<t>
  <iref item="variant"/>
  <x:dfn>variant</x:dfn>
  <list>
    <t>
      A resource may have one, or more than one, representation(s)
      associated with it at any given instant. Each of these
      representations is termed a `varriant'.  Use of the term `variant'
      does not necessarily imply that the resource is subject to content
      negotiation.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
  <iref item="client"/>
  <x:dfn>client</x:dfn>

  </list>
</t>
<t>
  <iref item="user agent"/>
  <x:dfn>user agent</x:dfn>
  <list>
    <t>
      The client which initiates a request. These are often browsers,
      editors, spiders (web-traversing robots), or other end user tools.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
  <iref item="server"/>
  <x:dfn>server</x:dfn>
  <list>
    <t>
      An application program that accepts connections in order to
      service requests by sending back responses. Any given program may
      be capable of being both a client and a server; our use of these
      terms refers only to the role being performed by the program for a
      particular connection, rather than to the program's capabilities
      in general. Likewise, any server may act as an origin server,
      proxy, gateway, or tunnel, switching behavior based on the nature
      of each request.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
  <iref item="origin server"/>
  <x:dfn>origin server</x:dfn>
  <list>
    <t>
      The server on which a given resource resides or is to be created.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
  <iref item="proxy"/>
  <x:dfn>proxy</x:dfn>
  <list>
    <t>
      An intermediary program which acts as both a server and a client
      for the purpose of making requests on behalf of other clients.
      Requests are serviced internally or by passing them on, with
      possible translation, to other servers. A proxy &MUST; implement
      both the client and server requirements of this specification. A
      "transparent proxy" is a proxy that does not modify the request or
      response beyond what is required for proxy authentication and
      identification. A "non-transparent proxy" is a proxy that modifies
      the request or response in order to provide some added service to
      the user agent, such as group annotation services, media type
      transformation, protocol reduction, or anonymity filtering. Except
      where either transparent or non-transparent behavior is explicitly
      stated, the HTTP proxy requirements apply to both types of
      proxies.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
  <iref item="gateway"/>
  <x:dfn>gateway</x:dfn>
  <list>
    <t>
      A server which acts as an intermediary for some other server.
      Unlike a proxy, a gateway receives requests as if it were the
      origin server for the requested resource; the requesting client
      may not be aware that it is communicating with a gateway.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
  <iref item="tunnel"/>
  <x:dfn>tunnel</x:dfn>
  <list>
    <t>
      An intermediary program which is acting as a blind relay between
      two connections. Once active, a tunnel is not considered a party
      to the HTTP communication, though the tunnel may have been
      initiated by an HTTP request. The tunnel ceases to exist when both
      ends of the relayed connections are closed.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
  <iref item="cache"/>
  <x:dfn>cache</x:dfn>
  <list>
    <t>
      A program's local store of response messages and the subsystem
      that controls its message storage, retrieval, and deletion. A
      cache stores cacheable responses in order to reduce the response
      time and network bandwidth consumption on future, equivalent
      requests. Any client or server may include a cache, though a cache
      cannot be used by a server that is acting as a tunnel.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
  <iref item="cacheable"/>
  <x:dfn>cacheable</x:dfn>
  <list>
    <t>
      A response is cacheable if a cache is allowed to store a copy of
      the response message for use in answering subsequent requests. The
      rules for determining the cacheability of HTTP responses are
      defined in <xref target="caching"/>. Even if a resource is cacheable, there may
      be additional constraints on whether a cache can use the cached
      copy for a particular request.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
  <iref item="first-hand"/>
  <x:dfn>first-hand</x:dfn>
  <list>
    <t>
      A response is first-hand if it comes directly and without
      unnecessary delay from the origin server, perhaps via one or more
      proxies. A response is also first-hand if its validity has just
      been checked directly with the origin server.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
  <iref item="explicit expiration time"/>
  <x:dfn>explicit expiration time</x:dfn>
  <list>
    <t>
      The time at which the origin server intends that an entity should
      no longer be returned by a cache without further validation.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
  <iref item="heuristic expiration time"/>
  <x:dfn>heuristic expiration time</x:dfn>
  <list>
    <t>
      An expiration time assigned by a cache when no explicit expiration
      time is available.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
  <iref item="age"/>
  <x:dfn>age</x:dfn>
  <list>
    <t>
      The age of a response is the time since it was sent by, or
      successfully validated with, the origin server.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
  <iref item="freshness lifetime"/>
  <x:dfn>freshness lifetime</x:dfn>
  <list>
    <t>
      The length of time between the generation of a response and its
      expiration time.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
  <iref item="fresh"/>
  <x:dfn>fresh</x:dfn>
  <list>
    <t>
      A response is fresh if its age has not yet exceeded its freshness
      lifetime.

  <iref item="stale"/>
  <x:dfn>stale</x:dfn>
  <list>
    <t>
      A response is stale if its age has passed its freshness lifetime.

  </list>
</t>
<t>
  <iref item="semantically transparent"/>
  <x:dfn>semantically transparent</x:dfn>
  <list>
    <t>
      A cache behaves in a "semantically transparent" manner, with
      respect to a particular response, when its use affects neither the
      requesting client nor the origin server, except to improve
      performance. When a cache is semantically transparent, the client
      receives exactly the same response (except for hop-by-hop headers)
      that it would have received had its request been handled directly
      by the origin server.

<section title="Overall Operation" anchor="intro.overall.operation">
<t>
   The HTTP protocol is a request/response protocol. A client sends a
   request to the server in the form of a request method, URI, and
   protocol version, followed by a MIME-like message containing request
   modifiers, client information, and possible body content over a
   connection with a server. The server responds with a status line,
   including the message's protocol version and a success or error code,
   followed by a MIME-like message containing server information, entity
   metainformation, and possible entity-body content. The relationship
   between HTTP and MIME is described in <xref target="differences.between.http.entities.and.rfc.2045.entities"/>.
</t>
<t>
   Most HTTP communication is initiated by a user agent and consists of
   a request to be applied to a resource on some origin server. In the
   simplest case, this may be accomplished via a single connection (v)
   between the user agent (UA) and the origin server (O).
</t>
<figure><artwork type="drawing">
       request chain ------------------------&gt;
    UA -------------------v------------------- O
       &lt;----------------------- response chain
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   A more complicated situation occurs when one or more intermediaries
   are present in the request/response chain. There are three common
   forms of intermediary: proxy, gateway, and tunnel. A proxy is a
   forwarding agent, receiving requests for a URI in its absolute form,
   rewriting all or part of the message, and forwarding the reformatted
   request toward the server identified by the URI. A gateway is a
   receiving agent, acting as a layer above some other server(s) and, if
   necessary, translating the requests to the underlying server's
   protocol. A tunnel acts as a relay point between two connections
   without changing the messages; tunnels are used when the
   communication needs to pass through an intermediary (such as a
   firewall) even when the intermediary cannot understand the contents
   of the messages.
</t>
<figure><artwork type="drawing">
       request chain --------------------------------------&gt;
    UA -----v----- A -----v----- B -----v----- C -----v----- O
       &lt;------------------------------------- response chain
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   The figure above shows three intermediaries (A, B, and C) between the
   user agent and origin server. A request or response message that
   travels the whole chain will pass through four separate connections.
   This distinction is important because some HTTP communication options
   may apply only to the connection with the nearest, non-tunnel
   neighbor, only to the end-points of the chain, or to all connections
   along the chain. Although the diagram is linear, each participant may
   be engaged in multiple, simultaneous communications. For example, B
   may be receiving requests from many clients other than A, and/or
   forwarding requests to servers other than C, at the same time that it
   is handling A's request.
</t>
<t>
   Any party to the communication which is not acting as a tunnel may
   employ an internal cache for handling requests. The effect of a cache
   is that the request/response chain is shortened if one of the
   participants along the chain has a cached response applicable to that
   request. The following illustrates the resulting chain if B has a
   cached copy of an earlier response from O (via C) for a request which
   has not been cached by UA or A.

<t>
   Not all responses are usefully cacheable, and some requests may
   contain modifiers which place special requirements on cache behavior.
   HTTP requirements for cache behavior and cacheable responses are
   defined in <xref target="caching"/>.
</t>
<t>
   In fact, there are a wide variety of architectures and configurations
   of caches and proxies currently being experimented with or deployed
   across the World Wide Web. These systems include national hierarchies
   of proxy caches to save transoceanic bandwidth, systems that
   broadcast or multicast cache entries, organizations that distribute
   subsets of cached data via CD-ROM, and so on. HTTP systems are used
   in corporate intranets over high-bandwidth links, and for access via
   PDAs with low-power radio links and intermittent connectivity. The
   goal of HTTP/1.1 is to support the wide diversity of configurations
   already deployed while introducing protocol constructs that meet the
   needs of those who build web applications that require high
   reliability and, failing that, at least reliable indications of
   failure.
</t>
<t>
   HTTP communication usually takes place over TCP/IP connections. The
   default port is TCP 80 <xref target="RFC1700"/>, but other ports can be used. This does
   not preclude HTTP from being implemented on top of any other protocol
   on the Internet, or on other networks. HTTP only presumes a reliable
   transport; any protocol that provides such guarantees can be used;
   the mapping of the HTTP/1.1 request and response structures onto the
   transport data units of the protocol in question is outside the scope
   of this specification.
</t>
<t>
   In HTTP/1.0, most implementations used a new connection for each
   request/response exchange. In HTTP/1.1, a connection may be used for
   one or more request/response exchanges, although connections may be
   closed for a variety of reasons (see <xref target="persistent.connections"/>).

<section title="Augmented BNF" anchor="notation.abnf">
<t>
   All of the mechanisms specified in this document are described in
   both prose and an augmented Backus-Naur Form (BNF) similar to that
   used by RFC 822 <xref target="RFC822"/>. Implementors will need to be familiar with the
   notation in order to understand this specification. The augmented BNF
   includes the following constructs:
</t>
<t>
   name = definition
  <list>
    <t>
      The name of a rule is simply the name itself (without any
      enclosing "&lt;" and "&gt;") and is separated from its definition by the
      equal "=" character. White space is only significant in that
      indentation of continuation lines is used to indicate a rule
      definition that spans more than one line. Certain basic rules are
      in uppercase, such as <x:ref>SP</x:ref>, <x:ref>LWS</x:ref>, <x:ref>HT</x:ref>, <x:ref>CRLF</x:ref>, <x:ref>DIGIT</x:ref>, <x:ref>ALPHA</x:ref>, etc. Angle
      brackets are used within definitions whenever their presence will
      facilitate discerning the use of rule names.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   "literal"
  <list>
    <t>
      Quotation marks surround literal text. Unless stated otherwise,
      the text is case-insensitive.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   rule1 | rule2
  <list>
    <t>
      Elements separated by a bar ("|") are alternatives, e.g., "yes |
      no" will accept yes or no.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   (rule1 rule2)
  <list>
    <t>
      Elements enclosed in parentheses are treated as a single element.
      Thus, "(elem (foo | bar) elem)" allows the token sequences "elem
      foo elem" and "elem bar elem".
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   *rule
  <list>
    <t>
      The character "*" preceding an element indicates repetition. The
      full form is "&lt;n&gt;*&lt;m&gt;element" indicating at least &lt;n&gt; and at most
      &lt;m&gt; occurrences of element. Default values are 0 and infinity so
      that "*(element)" allows any number, including zero; "1*element"
      requires at least one; and "1*2element" allows one or two.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   [rule]
  <list>
    <t>
      Square brackets enclose optional elements; "[foo bar]" is
      equivalent to "*1(foo bar)".
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   N rule
  <list>
    <t>
      Specific repetition: "&lt;n&gt;(element)" is equivalent to
      "&lt;n&gt;*&lt;n&gt;(element)"; that is, exactly &lt;n&gt; occurrences of (element).
      Thus 2DIGIT is a 2-digit number, and 3ALPHA is a string of three
      alphabetic characters.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   #rule
  <list>
    <t>
      A construct "#" is defined, similar to "*", for defining lists of
      elements. The full form is "&lt;n&gt;#&lt;m&gt;element" indicating at least
      &lt;n&gt; and at most &lt;m&gt; elements, each separated by one or more commas
      (",") and &OPTIONAL; linear white space (LWS). This makes the usual
      form of lists very easy; a rule such as
    <figure><artwork type="example">
   ( *LWS element *( *LWS "," *LWS element ))
</artwork></figure>
    </t>
    <t>
      can be shown as
    <figure><artwork type="example">
   1#element
</artwork></figure>
    </t>
    <t>
      Wherever this construct is used, null elements are allowed, but do
      not contribute to the count of elements present. That is,
      "(element), , (element) " is permitted, but counts as only two
      elements. Therefore, where at least one element is required, at
      least one non-null element &MUST; be present. Default values are 0
      and infinity so that "#element" allows any number, including zero;
      "1#element" requires at least one; and "1#2element" allows one or
      two.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   ; comment
  <list>
    <t>
      A semi-colon, set off some distance to the right of rule text,
      starts a comment that continues to the end of line. This is a
      simple way of including useful notes in parallel with the
      specifications.

      interpretation of a field. At least one delimiter (LWS and/or

<section title="HTTP Version" anchor="http.version">
  <x:anchor-alias value="HTTP-Version"/>
<t>
   HTTP uses a "&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;" numbering scheme to indicate versions
   of the protocol. The protocol versioning policy is intended to allow
   the sender to indicate the format of a message and its capacity for
   understanding further HTTP communication, rather than the features
   obtained via that communication. No change is made to the version
   number for the addition of message components which do not affect
   communication behavior or which only add to extensible field values.
   The &lt;minor&gt; number is incremented when the changes made to the
   protocol add features which do not change the general message parsing
   algorithm, but which may add to the message semantics and imply
   additional capabilities of the sender. The &lt;major&gt; number is
   incremented when the format of a message within the protocol is
   changed. See RFC 2145 <xref target="RFC2145"/> for a fuller explanation.
</t>
<t>
   The version of an HTTP message is indicated by an HTTP-Version field
   in the first line of the message.
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="HTTP-Version" x:for-anchor="HTTP-Version"/>

</artwork></figure>
<t>
   Note that the major and minor numbers &MUST; be treated as separate
   integers and that each &MAY; be incremented higher than a single digit.
   Thus, HTTP/2.4 is a lower version than HTTP/2.13, which in turn is
   lower than HTTP/12.3. Leading zeros &MUST; be ignored by recipients and
   &MUST-NOT; be sent.
</t>
<t>
   An application that sends a request or response message that includes
   HTTP-Version of "HTTP/1.1" &MUST; be at least conditionally compliant
   with this specification. Applications that are at least conditionally
   compliant with this specification &SHOULD; use an HTTP-Version of
   "HTTP/1.1" in their messages, and &MUST; do so for any message that is
   not compatible with HTTP/1.0. For more details on when to send
   specific HTTP-Version values, see RFC 2145 <xref target="RFC2145"/>.
</t>
<t>
   The HTTP version of an application is the highest HTTP version for
   which the application is at least conditionally compliant.
</t>
<t>
   Proxy and gateway applications need to be careful when forwarding
   messages in protocol versions different from that of the application.
   Since the protocol version indicates the protocol capability of the
   sender, a proxy/gateway &MUST-NOT; send a message with a version
   indicator which is greater than its actual version. If a higher
   version request is received, the proxy/gateway &MUST; either downgrade
   the request version, or respond with an error, or switch to tunnel
   behavior.
</t>
<t>
   Due to interoperability problems with HTTP/1.0 proxies discovered
   since the publication of RFC 2068 <xref target="RFC2068"/>, caching proxies &MUST;, gateways
   &MAY;, and tunnels &MUST-NOT; upgrade the request to the highest version
   they support. The proxy/gateway's response to that request &MUST; be in
   the same major version as the request.

   URIs have been known by many names: WWW addresses, Universal Document
   Identifiers, Universal Resource Identifiers <xref target="RFC1630"/>, and finally the
   combination of Uniform Resource Locators (URL) <xref target="RFC1738"/> and Names (URN)
   <xref target="RFC1737"/>. As far as HTTP is concerned, Uniform Resource Identifiers are
   simply formatted strings which identify--via name, location, or any
   other characteristic--a resource.
</t>

<section title="General Syntax" anchor="general.syntax">
  <x:anchor-alias value="absoluteURI"/>
  <x:anchor-alias value="relativeURI"/>
<t>
   URIs in HTTP can be represented in absolute form or relative to some
   known base URI <xref target="RFC1808"/>, depending upon the context of their use. The two
   forms are differentiated by the fact that absolute URIs always begin
   with a scheme name followed by a colon. For definitive information on
   URL syntax and semantics, see "Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI):
   Generic Syntax and Semantics," RFC 2396 <xref target="RFC2396"/> (which replaces RFCs
   1738 <xref target="RFC1738"/> and RFC 1808 <xref target="RFC1808"/>). This specification adopts the
   definitions of "URI-reference", "absoluteURI", "relativeURI", "port",
   "host","abs_path", "rel_path", and "authority" from that
   specification.
</t>
<t>
   The HTTP protocol does not place any a priori limit on the length of
   a URI. Servers &MUST; be able to handle the URI of any resource they
   serve, and &SHOULD; be able to handle URIs of unbounded length if they
   provide GET-based forms that could generate such URIs. A server
   &SHOULD; return <x:ref>414 (Request-URI Too Long)</x:ref> status if a URI is longer

   If the port is empty or not given, port 80 is assumed. The semantics
   are that the identified resource is located at the server listening
   for TCP connections on that port of that host, and the Request-URI
   for the resource is abs_path (<xref target="request-uri"/>). The use of IP addresses
   in URLs &SHOULD; be avoided whenever possible (see RFC 1900 <xref target="RFC1900"/>). If
   the abs_path is not present in the URL, it &MUST; be given as "/" when
   used as a Request-URI for a resource (<xref target="request-uri"/>). If a proxy

   receives a host name which is not a fully qualified domain name, it
   &MAY; add its domain to the host name it received. If a proxy receives
   a fully qualified domain name, the proxy &MUST-NOT; change the host
   name.

<section title="URI Comparison" anchor="uri.comparison">
<t>
   When comparing two URIs to decide if they match or not, a client

    <t>A port that is empty or not given is equivalent to the default

<t>
   HTTP applications have historically allowed three different formats
   for the representation of date/time stamps:
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
   Sun, 06 Nov 1994 08:49:37 GMT  ; RFC 822, updated by RFC 1123
   Sunday, 06-Nov-94 08:49:37 GMT ; RFC 850, obsoleted by RFC 1036
   Sun Nov  6 08:49:37 1994       ; ANSI C's asctime() format
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   The first format is preferred as an Internet standard and represents
   a fixed-length subset of that defined by RFC 1123 <xref target="RFC1123"/> (an update to
   RFC 822 <xref target="RFC822"/>). The second format is in common use, but is based on the
   obsolete RFC 850 <xref target="RFC1036"/> date format and lacks a four-digit year.
   HTTP/1.1 clients and servers that parse the date value &MUST; accept
   all three formats (for compatibility with HTTP/1.0), though they &MUST;
   only generate the RFC 1123 format for representing HTTP-date values
   in header fields. See <xref target="tolerant.applications"/> for further information.
</t>
<t><list><t>
      <x:h>Note:</x:h> Recipients of date values are encouraged to be robust in
      accepting date values that may have been sent by non-HTTP
      applications, as is sometimes the case when retrieving or posting
      messages via proxies/gateways to SMTP or NNTP.
</t></list></t>
<t>
   All HTTP date/time stamps &MUST; be represented in Greenwich Mean Time
   (GMT), without exception. For the purposes of HTTP, GMT is exactly
   equal to UTC (Coordinated Universal Time). This is indicated in the
   first two formats by the inclusion of "GMT" as the three-letter
   abbreviation for time zone, and &MUST; be assumed when reading the
   asctime format. HTTP-date is case sensitive and &MUST-NOT; include
   additional LWS beyond that specifically included as SP in the
   grammar.

<section title="Character Sets" anchor="character.sets">
<t>
   HTTP uses the same definition of the term "character set" as that
   described for MIME:
</t>
<t>
   The term "character set" is used in this document to refer to a
   method used with one or more tables to convert a sequence of octets
   into a sequence of characters. Note that unconditional conversion in
   the other direction is not required, in that not all characters may
   be available in a given character set and a character set may provide
   more than one sequence of octets to represent a particular character.
   This definition is intended to allow various kinds of character
   encoding, from simple single-table mappings such as US-ASCII to
   complex table switching methods such as those that use ISO-2022's
   techniques. However, the definition associated with a MIME character
   set name &MUST; fully specify the mapping to be performed from octets
   to characters. In particular, use of external profiling information
   to determine the exact mapping is not permitted.
</t>
<t><list><t>
      <x:h>Note:</x:h> This use of the term "character set" is more commonly
      referred to as a "character encoding." However, since HTTP and
      MIME share the same registry, it is important that the terminology
      also be shared.
</t></list></t>
<t anchor="charset">
  <x:anchor-alias value="charset"/>
   HTTP character sets are identified by case-insensitive tokens. The
   complete set of tokens is defined by the IANA Character Set registry
   <xref target="RFC1700"/>.
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="charset"/>
    <x:ref>charset</x:ref> = <x:ref>token</x:ref>
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   Although HTTP allows an arbitrary token to be used as a charset
   value, any token that has a predefined value within the IANA
   Character Set registry <xref target="RFC1700"/> &MUST; represent the character set defined
   by that registry. Applications &SHOULD; limit their use of character
   sets to those defined by the IANA registry.
</t>
<t>
   Implementors should be aware of IETF character set requirements <xref target="RFC2279"/>
   <xref target="RFC2277"/>.
</t>

<section title="Missing Charset" anchor="missing.charset">
<t>
   Some HTTP/1.0 software has interpreted a Content-Type header without
   charset parameter incorrectly to mean "recipient should guess."
   Senders wishing to defeat this behavior &MAY; include a charset
   parameter even when the charset is ISO-8859-1 and &SHOULD; do so when
   it is known that it will not confuse the recipient.
</t>
<t>
   Unfortunately, some older HTTP/1.0 clients did not deal properly with
   an explicit charset parameter. HTTP/1.1 recipients &MUST; respect the
   charset label provided by the sender; and those user agents that have
   a provision to "guess" a charset &MUST; use the charset from the
   content-type field if they support that charset, rather than the
   recipient's preference, when initially displaying a document. See
   <xref target="canonicalization.and.text.defaults"/>.
</t>
</section>
</section>

<section title="Content Codings" anchor="content.codings">
  <x:anchor-alias value="content-coding"/>
  <iref item="Content Codings" primary="true"/>
<t>
   Content coding values indicate an encoding transformation that has
   been or can be applied to an entity. Content codings are primarily
   used to allow a document to be compressed or otherwise usefully
   transformed without losing the identity of its underlying media type
   and without loss of information. Frequently, the entity is stored in
   coded form, transmitted directly, and only decoded by the recipient.
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="content-coding"/>
    <x:ref>content-coding</x:ref>   = <x:ref>token</x:ref>
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   All content-coding values are case-insensitive. HTTP/1.1 uses
   content-coding values in the Accept-Encoding (<xref target="header.accept-encoding"/>) and
   Content-Encoding (<xref target="header.content-encoding"/>) header fields. Although the value
   describes the content-coding, what is more important is that it
   indicates what decoding mechanism will be required to remove the
   encoding.
</t>
<t>
   The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) acts as a registry for
   content-coding value tokens. Initially, the registry contains the
   following tokens:
</t>
<t>
   gzip<iref item="gzip (content coding)"/><iref item="Content Codings" subitem="gzip"/>
  <list>
    <t>
        An encoding format produced by the file compression program
        "gzip" (GNU zip) as described in RFC 1952 <xref target="RFC1952"/>. This format is a
        Lempel-Ziv coding (LZ77) with a 32 bit CRC.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   compress<iref item="compress (content coding)"/><iref item="Content Codings" subitem="compress"/>
  <list><t>
        The encoding format produced by the common UNIX file compression
        program "compress". This format is an adaptive Lempel-Ziv-Welch
        coding (LZW).
</t><t>
        Use of program names for the identification of encoding formats
        is not desirable and is discouraged for future encodings. Their
        use here is representative of historical practice, not good
        design. For compatibility with previous implementations of HTTP,
        applications &SHOULD; consider "x-gzip" and "x-compress" to be
        equivalent to "gzip" and "compress" respectively.
  </t></list>
</t>
<t>
   deflate<iref item="deflate (content coding)"/><iref item="Content Codings" subitem="deflate"/>
  <list><t>
        The "zlib" format defined in RFC 1950 <xref target="RFC1950"/> in combination with
        the "deflate" compression mechanism described in RFC 1951 <xref target="RFC1951"/>.
  </t></list>
</t>
<t>
   identity<iref item="identity (content coding)"/><iref item="Content Codings" subitem="identity"/>
  <list><t>
        The default (identity) encoding; the use of no transformation
        whatsoever. This content-coding is used only in the Accept-Encoding
        header, and &SHOULD-NOT;  be used in the Content-Encoding
        header.
  </t></list>
</t>
<t>
   New content-coding value tokens &SHOULD; be registered; to allow
   interoperability between clients and servers, specifications of the
   content coding algorithms needed to implement a new value &SHOULD; be
   publicly available and adequate for independent implementation, and
   conform to the purpose of content coding defined in this section.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Transfer Codings" anchor="transfer.codings">
  <x:anchor-alias value="transfer-coding"/>
<t>
   Transfer-coding values are used to indicate an encoding
   transformation that has been, can be, or may need to be applied to an
   entity-body in order to ensure "safe transport" through the network.
   This differs from a content coding in that the transfer-coding is a
   property of the message, not of the original entity.
</t>

    value                   = <x:ref>token</x:ref> | <x:ref>quoted-string</x:ref>
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   All transfer-coding values are case-insensitive. HTTP/1.1 uses
   transfer-coding values in the TE header field (<xref target="header.te"/>) and in
   the Transfer-Encoding header field (<xref target="header.transfer-encoding"/>).
</t>
<t>
   Whenever a transfer-coding is applied to a message-body, the set of
   transfer-codings &MUST; include "chunked", unless the message is
   terminated by closing the connection. When the "chunked" transfer-coding
   is used, it &MUST; be the last transfer-coding applied to the
   message-body. The "chunked" transfer-coding &MUST-NOT; be applied more
   than once to a message-body. These rules allow the recipient to
   determine the transfer-length of the message (<xref target="message.length"/>).
</t>
<t>
   Transfer-codings are analogous to the Content-Transfer-Encoding
   values of MIME <xref target="RFC2045"/>, which were designed to enable safe transport of
   binary data over a 7-bit transport service. However, safe transport
   has a different focus for an 8bit-clean transfer protocol. In HTTP,
   the only unsafe characteristic of message-bodies is the difficulty in
   determining the exact body length (<xref target="entity.length"/>), or the desire to
   encrypt data over a shared transport.
</t>
<t>
   The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) acts as a registry for
   transfer-coding value tokens. Initially, the registry contains the
   following tokens: "chunked" (<xref target="chunked.transfer.encoding"/>), "identity" (section
   3.6.2), "gzip" (<xref target="content.codings"/>), "compress" (<xref target="content.codings"/>), and "deflate"
   (<xref target="content.codings"/>).
</t>
<t>
   New transfer-coding value tokens &SHOULD; be registered in the same way
   as new content-coding value tokens (<xref target="content.codings"/>).
</t>
<t>
   A server which receives an entity-body with a transfer-coding it does
   not understand &SHOULD; return <x:ref>501 (Unimplemented)</x:ref>, and close the
   connection. A server &MUST-NOT; send transfer-codings to an HTTP/1.0
   client.
</t>

<section title="Chunked Transfer Coding" anchor="chunked.transfer.encoding">
<t>
   The chunked encoding modifies the body of a message in order to
   transfer it as a series of chunks, each with its own size indicator,
   followed by an &OPTIONAL; trailer containing entity-header fields. This
   allows dynamically produced content to be transferred along with the
   information necessary for the recipient to verify that it has
   received the full message.
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="Chunked-Body"/><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="chunk"/><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="chunk-size"/><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="last-chunk"/><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="chunk-extension"/><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="chunk-ext-name"/><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="chunk-ext-val"/><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="chunk-data"/><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="trailer"/>

    trailer        = *(<x:ref>entity-header</x:ref> <x:ref>CRLF</x:ref>)
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   The chunk-size field is a string of hex digits indicating the size of
   the chunk. The chunked encoding is ended by any chunk whose size is
   zero, followed by the trailer, which is terminated by an empty line.
</t>
<t>
   The trailer allows the sender to include additional HTTP header
   fields at the end of the message. The Trailer header field can be
   used to indicate which header fields are included in a trailer (see
   <xref target="header.trailer"/>).
</t>
<t>
   A server using chunked transfer-coding in a response &MUST-NOT; use the
   trailer for any header fields unless at least one of the following is
   true:
  <list style="numbers">
    <t>the request included a TE header field that indicates "trailers" is
     acceptable in the transfer-coding of the  response, as described in
     <xref target="header.te"/>; or,</t>

    <t>the server is the origin server for the response, the trailer
     fields consist entirely of optional metadata, and the recipient
     could use the message (in a manner acceptable to the origin server)
     without receiving this metadata.  In other words, the origin server
     is willing to accept the possibility that the trailer fields might
     be silently discarded along the path to the client.</t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   This requirement prevents an interoperability failure when the
   message is being received by an HTTP/1.1 (or later) proxy and
   forwarded to an HTTP/1.0 recipient. It avoids a situation where
   compliance with the protocol would have necessitated a possibly
   infinite buffer on the proxy.

<t>
   An example process for decoding a Chunked-Body is presented in
   <xref target="introduction.of.transfer-encoding"/>.
</t>

   All HTTP/1.1 applications &MUST; be able to receive and decode the

<t>
   HTTP uses Internet Media Types <xref target="RFC1590"/> in the Content-Type (<xref target="header.content-type"/>)
   and Accept (<xref target="header.accept"/>) header fields in order to provide
   open and extensible data typing and type negotiation.
</t>

</artwork></figure>
<t>
   Parameters &MAY; follow the type/subtype in the form of attribute/value
   pairs (as defined in <xref target="transfer.codings"/>).
</t>
<t>
   The type, subtype, and parameter attribute names are case-insensitive.
   Parameter values might or might not be case-sensitive,
   depending on the semantics of the parameter name. Linear white space
   (LWS) &MUST-NOT; be used between the type and subtype, nor between an
   attribute and its value. The presence or absence of a parameter might
   be significant to the processing of a media-type, depending on its
   definition within the media type registry.
</t>
<t>
   Note that some older HTTP applications do not recognize media type
   parameters. When sending data to older HTTP applications,
   implementations &SHOULD; only use media type parameters when they are
   required by that type/subtype definition.
</t>
<t>
   Media-type values are registered with the Internet Assigned Number
   Authority (IANA <xref target="RFC1700"/>). The media type registration process is
   outlined in RFC 1590 <xref target="RFC1590"/>. Use of non-registered media types is
   discouraged.
</t>

<section title="Canonicalization and Text Defaults" anchor="canonicalization.and.text.defaults">
<t>
   Internet media types are registered with a canonical form. An
   entity-body transferred via HTTP messages &MUST; be represented in the
   appropriate canonical form prior to its transmission except for
   "text" types, as defined in the next paragraph.
</t>
<t>
   When in canonical form, media subtypes of the "text" type use CRLF as
   the text line break. HTTP relaxes this requirement and allows the
   transport of text media with plain CR or LF alone representing a line
   break when it is done consistently for an entire entity-body. HTTP
   applications &MUST; accept CRLF, bare CR, and bare LF as being
   representative of a line break in text media received via HTTP. In
   addition, if the text is represented in a character set that does not
   use octets 13 and 10 for CR and LF respectively, as is the case for
   some multi-byte character sets, HTTP allows the use of whatever octet
   sequences are defined by that character set to represent the
   equivalent of CR and LF for line breaks. This flexibility regarding
   line breaks applies only to text media in the entity-body; a bare CR
   or LF &MUST-NOT; be substituted for CRLF within any of the HTTP control
   structures (such as header fields and multipart boundaries).
</t>
<t>
   If an entity-body is encoded with a content-coding, the underlying
   data &MUST; be in a form defined above prior to being encoded.
</t>
<t>
   The "charset" parameter is used with some media types to define the
   character set (<xref target="character.sets"/>) of the data. When no explicit charset
   parameter is provided by the sender, media subtypes of the "text"
   type are defined to have a default charset value of "ISO-8859-1" when
   received via HTTP. Data in character sets other than "ISO-8859-1" or
   its subsets &MUST; be labeled with an appropriate charset value. See
   <xref target="missing.charset"/> for compatibility problems.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Multipart Types" anchor="multipart.types">
<t>
   MIME provides for a number of "multipart" types -- encapsulations of
   one or more entities within a single message-body. All multipart
   types share a common syntax, as defined in section <xref target="RFC2046" x:sec="5.1.1" x:fmt="number"/> of RFC 2046
   <xref target="RFC2046"/>, and &MUST; include a boundary parameter as part of the media type
   value. The message body is itself a protocol element and &MUST;
   therefore use only CRLF to represent line breaks between body-parts.
   Unlike in RFC 2046, the epilogue of any multipart message &MUST; be
   empty; HTTP applications &MUST-NOT; transmit the epilogue (even if the
   original multipart contains an epilogue). These restrictions exist in
   order to preserve the self-delimiting nature of a multipart message-body,
   wherein the "end" of the message-body is indicated by the
   ending multipart boundary.
</t>
<t>
   In general, HTTP treats a multipart message-body no differently than
   any other media type: strictly as payload. The one exception is the
   "multipart/byteranges" type (<xref target="internet.media.type.multipart.byteranges"/>) when it appears in a 206
   (Partial Content) response, which will be interpreted by some HTTP
   caching mechanisms as described in sections <xref target="combining.byte.ranges" format="counter"/>
   and <xref target="header.content-range" format="counter"/>. In all
   other cases, an HTTP user agent &SHOULD; follow the same or similar
   behavior as a MIME user agent would upon receipt of a multipart type.
   The MIME header fields within each body-part of a multipart message-body
   do not have any significance to HTTP beyond that defined by
   their MIME semantics.

   In general, an HTTP user agent &SHOULD; follow the same or similar
   behavior as a MIME user agent would upon receipt of a multipart type.
   If an application receives an unrecognized multipart subtype, the
   application &MUST; treat it as being equivalent to "multipart/mixed".

<section title="Product Tokens" anchor="product.tokens">
  <x:anchor-alias value="product"/>
<t>
   Product tokens are used to allow communicating applications to
   identify themselves by software name and version. Most fields using
   product tokens also allow sub-products which form a significant part
   of the application to be listed, separated by white space. By
   convention, the products are listed in order of their significance
   for identifying the application.
</t>

    Server: Apache/0.8.4
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   Product tokens &SHOULD; be short and to the point. They &MUST-NOT; be
   used for advertising or other non-essential information. Although any
   token character &MAY; appear in a product-version, this token &SHOULD;
   only be used for a version identifier (i.e., successive versions of
   the same product &SHOULD; only differ in the product-version portion of
   the product value).
</t>
</section>

<section title="Quality Values" anchor="quality.values">
  <x:anchor-alias value="qvalue"/>
<t>
   HTTP content negotiation (<xref target="content.negotiation"/>) uses short "floating point"
   numbers to indicate the relative importance ("weight") of various
   negotiable parameters.  A weight is normalized to a real number in
   the range 0 through 1, where 0 is the minimum and 1 the maximum
   value. If a parameter has a quality value of 0, then content with
   this parameter is `not acceptable' for the client. HTTP/1.1
   applications &MUST-NOT; generate more than three digits after the
   decimal point. User configuration of these values &SHOULD; also be
   limited in this fashion.
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="qvalue"/>
    <x:ref>qvalue</x:ref>         = ( "0" [ "." 0*3<x:ref>DIGIT</x:ref> ] )
                   | ( "1" [ "." 0*3("0") ] )

<t>
   "Quality values" is a misnomer, since these values merely represent
   relative degradation in desired quality.

<section title="Language Tags" anchor="language.tags">
  <x:anchor-alias value="language-tag"/>
<t>
   A language tag identifies a natural language spoken, written, or
   otherwise conveyed by human beings for communication of information
   to other human beings. Computer languages are explicitly excluded.
   HTTP uses language tags within the Accept-Language and Content-Language
   fields.
</t>
<t>
   The syntax and registry of HTTP language tags is the same as that
   defined by RFC 1766 <xref target="RFC1766"/>. In summary, a language tag is composed of 1
   or more parts: A primary language tag and a possibly empty series of
   subtags:
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="language-tag"/><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="primary-tag"/><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="subtag"/>
     <x:ref>language-tag</x:ref>  = primary-tag *( "-" subtag )
     primary-tag   = 1*8<x:ref>ALPHA</x:ref>
     subtag        = 1*8<x:ref>ALPHA</x:ref>
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   White space is not allowed within the tag and all tags are case-insensitive.
   The name space of language tags is administered by the
   IANA. Example tags include:
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
    en, en-US, en-cockney, i-cherokee, x-pig-latin
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   where any two-letter primary-tag is an ISO-639 language abbreviation
   and any two-letter initial subtag is an ISO-3166 country code. (The
   last three tags above are not registered tags; all but the last are
   examples of tags which could be registered in future.)
</t>
</section>

<section title="Entity Tags" anchor="entity.tags">
  <x:anchor-alias value="entity-tag"/>
<t>
   Entity tags are used for comparing two or more entities from the same
   requested resource. HTTP/1.1 uses entity tags in the ETag (<xref target="header.etag"/>),
   If-Match (<xref target="header.if-match"/>), If-None-Match (<xref target="header.if-none-match"/>), and
   If-Range (<xref target="header.if-range"/>) header fields. The definition of how they
   are used and compared as cache validators is in <xref target="weak.and.strong.validators"/>. An
   entity tag consists of an opaque quoted string, possibly prefixed by
   a weakness indicator.
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="entity-tag"/><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="weak"/><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="opaque-tag"/>
   <x:ref>entity-tag</x:ref> = [ weak ] opaque-tag
   weak       = "W/"
   opaque-tag = <x:ref>quoted-string</x:ref>
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   A "strong entity tag" &MAY; be shared by two entities of a resource
   only if they are equivalent by octet equality.
</t>
<t>
   A "weak entity tag," indicated by the "W/" prefix, &MAY; be shared by
   two entities of a resource only if the entities are equivalent and
   could be substituted for each other with no significant change in
   semantics. A weak entity tag can only be used for weak comparison.
</t>
<t>
   An entity tag &MUST; be unique across all versions of all entities
   associated with a particular resource. A given entity tag value &MAY;
   be used for entities obtained by requests on different URIs. The use
   of the same entity tag value in conjunction with entities obtained by
   requests on different URIs does not imply the equivalence of those
   entities.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Range Units" anchor="range.units">
  <x:anchor-alias value="range-unit"/>
<t>
   HTTP/1.1 allows a client to request that only part (a range of) the
   response entity be included within the response. HTTP/1.1 uses range
   units in the Range (<xref target="header.range"/>) and Content-Range (<xref target="header.content-range"/>)
   header fields. An entity can be broken down into subranges according
   to various structural units.
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="range-unit"/><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="bytes-unit"/><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="other-range-unit"/>

   bytes-unit       = "bytes"
   other-range-unit = <x:ref>token</x:ref>
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   The only range unit defined by HTTP/1.1 is "bytes". HTTP/1.1
   implementations &MAY; ignore ranges specified using other units.
</t>
<t>
   HTTP/1.1 has been designed to allow implementations of applications
   that do not depend on knowledge of ranges.

<section title="HTTP Message" anchor="http.message">

<section title="Message Types" anchor="message.types">
  <x:anchor-alias value="HTTP-message"/>
<t>
   HTTP messages consist of requests from client to server and responses
   from server to client.
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="HTTP-message"/>
    HTTP-message   = <x:ref>Request</x:ref> | <x:ref>Response</x:ref>     ; HTTP/1.1 messages
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   Request (<xref target="request"/>) and Response (<xref target="response"/>) messages use the generic
   message format of RFC 822 <xref target="RFC822"/> for transferring entities (the payload
   of the message). Both types of message consist of a start-line, zero
   or more header fields (also known as "headers"), an empty line (i.e.,
   a line with nothing preceding the CRLF) indicating the end of the
   header fields, and possibly a message-body.
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="generic-message"/><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="start-line"/>
     generic-message = start-line
                       *(<x:ref>message-header</x:ref> <x:ref>CRLF</x:ref>)
                       <x:ref>CRLF</x:ref>
                       [ <x:ref>message-body</x:ref> ]
     start-line      = <x:ref>Request-Line</x:ref> | <x:ref>Status-Line</x:ref>
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   In the interest of robustness, servers &SHOULD; ignore any empty
   line(s) received where a Request-Line is expected. In other words, if
   the server is reading the protocol stream at the beginning of a
   message and receives a CRLF first, it should ignore the CRLF.
</t>
<t>
   Certain buggy HTTP/1.0 client implementations generate extra CRLF's
   after a POST request. To restate what is explicitly forbidden by the
   BNF, an HTTP/1.1 client &MUST-NOT; preface or follow a request with an
   extra CRLF.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Message Headers" anchor="message.headers">
  <x:anchor-alias value="message-header"/>
  <x:anchor-alias value="field-name"/>
<t>
   HTTP header fields, which include general-header (<xref target="general.header.fields"/>),
   request-header (<xref target="request.header.fields"/>), response-header (<xref target="response.header.fields"/>), and
   entity-header (<xref target="entity.header.fields"/>) fields, follow the same generic format as
   that given in <xref target="RFC822" x:fmt="sec" x:sec="3.1"/> of RFC 822 <xref target="RFC822"/>. Each header field consists
   of a name followed by a colon (":") and the field value. Field names
   are case-insensitive. The field value &MAY; be preceded by any amount
   of LWS, though a single SP is preferred. Header fields can be
   extended over multiple lines by preceding each extra line with at
   least one SP or HT. Applications ought to follow "common form", where
   one is known or indicated, when generating HTTP constructs, since
   there might exist some implementations that fail to accept anything
   beyond the common forms.
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="message-header"/><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="field-name"/><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="field-value"/><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="field-content"/>

    field-value    = *( field-content | <x:ref>LWS</x:ref> )
    field-content  = &lt;the <x:ref>OCTET</x:ref>s making up the field-value
                     and consisting of either *<x:ref>TEXT</x:ref> or combinations
                     of <x:ref>token</x:ref>, <x:ref>separators</x:ref>, and <x:ref>quoted-string</x:ref>&gt;
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   The field-content does not include any leading or trailing LWS:
   linear white space occurring before the first non-whitespace
   character of the field-value or after the last non-whitespace
   character of the field-value. Such leading or trailing LWS &MAY; be
   removed without changing the semantics of the field value. Any LWS
   that occurs between field-content &MAY; be replaced with a single SP
   before interpreting the field value or forwarding the message
   downstream.
</t>
<t>
   The order in which header fields with differing field names are
   received is not significant. However, it is "good practice" to send
   general-header fields first, followed by request-header or response-header
   fields, and ending with the entity-header fields.
</t>
<t>
   Multiple message-header fields with the same field-name &MAY; be
   present in a message if and only if the entire field-value for that
   header field is defined as a comma-separated list [i.e., #(values)].
   It &MUST; be possible to combine the multiple header fields into one
   "field-name: field-value" pair, without changing the semantics of the
   message, by appending each subsequent field-value to the first, each
   separated by a comma. The order in which header fields with the same
   field-name are received is therefore significant to the
   interpretation of the combined field value, and thus a proxy &MUST-NOT;
   change the order of these field values when a message is forwarded.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Message Body" anchor="message.body">
  <x:anchor-alias value="message-body"/>
<t>
   The message-body (if any) of an HTTP message is used to carry the
   entity-body associated with the request or response. The message-body
   differs from the entity-body only when a transfer-coding has been
   applied, as indicated by the Transfer-Encoding header field (<xref target="header.transfer-encoding"/>).
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="message-body"/>
    <x:ref>message-body</x:ref> = <x:ref>entity-body</x:ref>
                 | &lt;<x:ref>entity-body</x:ref> encoded as per Transfer-Encoding&gt;
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   Transfer-Encoding &MUST; be used to indicate any transfer-codings
   applied by an application to ensure safe and proper transfer of the
   message. Transfer-Encoding is a property of the message, not of the
   entity, and thus &MAY; be added or removed by any application along the
   request/response chain. (However, <xref target="transfer.codings"/> places restrictions on
   when certain transfer-codings may be used.)
</t>
<t>
   The rules for when a message-body is allowed in a message differ for
   requests and responses.
</t>
<t>
   The presence of a message-body in a request is signaled by the
   inclusion of a Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding header field in
   the request's message-headers. A message-body &MUST-NOT; be included in
   a request if the specification of the request method (<xref target="method"/>)
   does not allow sending an entity-body in requests. A server &SHOULD;
   read and forward a message-body on any request; if the request method
   does not include defined semantics for an entity-body, then the
   message-body &SHOULD; be ignored when handling the request.
</t>
<t>
   For response messages, whether or not a message-body is included with
   a message is dependent on both the request method and the response
   status code (<xref target="status.code.and.reason.phrase"/>). All responses to the HEAD request method
   &MUST-NOT; include a message-body, even though the presence of entity-header
   fields might lead one to believe they do. All 1xx
   (informational), <x:ref>204 (no content)</x:ref>, and <x:ref>304 (not modified)</x:ref> responses
   &MUST-NOT; include a message-body. All other responses do include a
   message-body, although it &MAY; be of zero length.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Message Length" anchor="message.length">
<t>
   The transfer-length of a message is the length of the message-body as
   it appears in the message; that is, after any transfer-codings have
   been applied. When a message-body is included with a message, the
   transfer-length of that body is determined by one of the following
   (in order of precedence):
</t>
<t>
  <list style="numbers">
    <x:lt><t>
     Any response message which "&MUST-NOT;" include a message-body (such
     as the 1xx, 204, and 304 responses and any response to a HEAD
     request) is always terminated by the first empty line after the
     header fields, regardless of the entity-header fields present in
     the message.
    </t></x:lt>
    <x:lt><t>
     If a Transfer-Encoding header field (<xref target="header.transfer-encoding"/>) is present and
     has any value other than "identity", then the transfer-length is
     defined by use of the "chunked" transfer-coding (<xref target="transfer.codings"/>),
     unless the message is terminated by closing the connection.
    </t></x:lt>
    <x:lt><t>
     If a Content-Length header field (<xref target="header.content-length"/>) is present, its
     decimal value in <x:ref>OCTET</x:ref>s represents both the entity-length and the
     transfer-length. The Content-Length header field &MUST-NOT; be sent
     if these two lengths are different (i.e., if a Transfer-Encoding
     header field is present). If a message is received with both a
     Transfer-Encoding header field and a Content-Length header field,
     the latter &MUST; be ignored.
    </t></x:lt>
    <x:lt><t>
     If the message uses the media type "multipart/byteranges", and the
     ransfer-length is not otherwise specified, then this self-elimiting
     media type defines the transfer-length. This media type
     UST NOT be used unless the sender knows that the recipient can arse
     it; the presence in a request of a Range header with ultiple byte-range
     specifiers from a 1.1 client implies that the lient can parse
     multipart/byteranges responses.
    <list style="empty"><t>
       A range header might be forwarded by a 1.0 proxy that does not
       understand multipart/byteranges; in this case the server &MUST;
       delimit the message using methods defined in items 1, 3 or 5 of
       this section.
    </t></list>
    </t></x:lt>
    <x:lt><t>
     By the server closing the connection. (Closing the connection
     cannot be used to indicate the end of a request body, since that
     would leave no possibility for the server to send back a response.)
    </t></x:lt>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   For compatibility with HTTP/1.0 applications, HTTP/1.1 requests
   containing a message-body &MUST; include a valid Content-Length header
   field unless the server is known to be HTTP/1.1 compliant. If a
   request contains a message-body and a Content-Length is not given,
   the server &SHOULD; respond with <x:ref>400 (bad request)</x:ref> if it cannot
   determine the length of the message, or with <x:ref>411 (length required)</x:ref> if
   it wishes to insist on receiving a valid Content-Length.
</t>
<t>
   All HTTP/1.1 applications that receive entities &MUST; accept the
   "chunked" transfer-coding (<xref target="transfer.codings"/>), thus allowing this mechanism
   to be used for messages when the message length cannot be determined
   in advance.
</t>
<t>
   Messages &MUST-NOT; include both a Content-Length header field and a
   non-identity transfer-coding. If the message does include a non-identity
   transfer-coding, the Content-Length &MUST; be ignored.
</t>
<t>
   When a Content-Length is given in a message where a message-body is
   allowed, its field value &MUST; exactly match the number of <x:ref>OCTET</x:ref>s in
   the message-body. HTTP/1.1 user agents &MUST; notify the user when an
   invalid length is received and detected.

<section title="General Header Fields" anchor="general.header.fields">
  <x:anchor-alias value="general-header"/>

   General-header field names can be extended reliably only in
   combination with a change in the protocol version. However, new or
   experimental header fields may be given the semantics of general
   header fields if all parties in the communication recognize them to

   The list of methods allowed by a resource can be specified in an
   Allow header field (<xref target="header.allow"/>). The return code of the response
   always notifies the client whether a method is currently allowed on a
   resource, since the set of allowed methods can change dynamically. An
   origin server &SHOULD; return the status code <x:ref>405 (Method Not Allowed)</x:ref>
   if the method is known by the origin server but not allowed for the
   requested resource, and <x:ref>501 (Not Implemented)</x:ref> if the method is
   unrecognized or not implemented by the origin server. The methods GET
   and HEAD &MUST; be supported by all general-purpose servers. All other
   methods are &OPTIONAL;; however, if the above methods are implemented,
   they &MUST; be implemented with the same semantics as those specified
   in <xref target="method.definitions"/>.

</section>

<section title="Request-URI" anchor="request-uri">
  <x:anchor-alias value="Request-URI"/>
<t>
   The Request-URI is a Uniform Resource Identifier (<xref target="uri"/>) and
   identifies the resource upon which to apply the request.
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="Request-URI"/>
    <x:ref>Request-URI</x:ref>    = "*" | <x:ref>absoluteURI</x:ref> | abs_path | authority
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   The four options for Request-URI are dependent on the nature of the
   request. The asterisk "*" means that the request does not apply to a
   particular resource, but to the server itself, and is only allowed
   when the method used does not necessarily apply to a resource. One
   example would be
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
    OPTIONS * HTTP/1.1
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   The absoluteURI form is &REQUIRED; when the request is being made to a
   proxy. The proxy is requested to forward the request or service it
   from a valid cache, and return the response. Note that the proxy &MAY;
   forward the request on to another proxy or directly to the server
   specified by the absoluteURI. In order to avoid request loops, a
   proxy &MUST; be able to recognize all of its server names, including
   any aliases, local variations, and the numeric IP address. An example
   Request-Line would be:
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
    GET http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/TheProject.html HTTP/1.1
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   To allow for transition to absoluteURIs in all requests in future
   versions of HTTP, all HTTP/1.1 servers &MUST; accept the absoluteURI
   form in requests, even though HTTP/1.1 clients will only generate
   them in requests to proxies.
</t>
<t>
   The authority form is only used by the CONNECT method (<xref target="CONNECT"/>).
</t>
<t>
   The most common form of Request-URI is that used to identify a
   resource on an origin server or gateway. In this case the absolute
   path of the URI &MUST; be transmitted (see <xref target="general.syntax"/>, abs_path) as
   the Request-URI, and the network location of the URI (authority) &MUST;
   be transmitted in a Host header field. For example, a client wishing
   to retrieve the resource above directly from the origin server would
   create a TCP connection to port 80 of the host "www.w3.org" and send
   the lines:
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
    GET /pub/WWW/TheProject.html HTTP/1.1
    Host: www.w3.org
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   followed by the remainder of the Request. Note that the absolute path
   cannot be empty; if none is present in the original URI, it &MUST; be
   given as "/" (the server root).
</t>
<t>
   The Request-URI is transmitted in the format specified in 
   <xref target="general.syntax"/>. If the Request-URI is encoded using the "% HEX HEX" encoding
   <xref target="RFC2396"/>, the origin server &MUST; decode the Request-URI in order to
   properly interpret the request. Servers &SHOULD; respond to invalid
   Request-URIs with an appropriate status code.
</t>
<t>
   A transparent proxy &MUST-NOT; rewrite the "abs_path" part of the
   received Request-URI when forwarding it to the next inbound server,
   except as noted above to replace a null abs_path with "/".
</t>
<t>
  <list><t>
      <x:h>Note:</x:h> The "no rewrite" rule prevents the proxy from changing the
      meaning of the request when the origin server is improperly using
      a non-reserved URI character for a reserved purpose.  Implementors
      should be aware that some pre-HTTP/1.1 proxies have been known to
      rewrite the Request-URI.

<section title="The Resource Identified by a Request" anchor="the.resource.identified.by.a.request">
<t>
   The exact resource identified by an Internet request is determined by
   examining both the Request-URI and the Host header field.
</t>
<t>
   An origin server that does not allow resources to differ by the

   determining the resource identified by an HTTP/1.1 request. (But see

   for other requirements on Host support in HTTP/1.1.)
</t>
<t>
   An origin server that does differentiate resources based on the host
   requested (sometimes referred to as virtual hosts or vanity host
   names) &MUST; use the following rules for determining the requested
   resource on an HTTP/1.1 request:
  <list style="numbers">
    <t>If Request-URI is an absoluteURI, the host is part of the
     Request-URI. Any Host header field value in the request &MUST; be
     ignored.</t>
    <t>If the Request-URI is not an absoluteURI, and the request includes
     a Host header field, the host is determined by the Host header
     field value.</t>
    <t>If the host as determined by rule 1 or 2 is not a valid host on
     the server, the response &MUST; be a <x:ref>400 (Bad Request)</x:ref> error message.</t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   Recipients of an HTTP/1.0 request that lacks a Host header field &MAY;
   attempt to use heuristics (e.g., examination of the URI path for
   something unique to a particular host) in order to determine what
   exact resource is being requested.

   safely assume that there was something wrong with its request and
   treat the response as if it had received a 400 status code. In such

<section title="Persistent Connections" anchor="persistent.connections">

<section title="Purpose" anchor="persistent.purpose">
<t>
   Prior to persistent connections, a separate TCP connection was
   established to fetch each URL, increasing the load on HTTP servers
   and causing congestion on the Internet. The use of inline images and
   other associated data often require a client to make multiple
   requests of the same server in a short amount of time. Analysis of
   these performance problems and results from a prototype
   implementation are available <xref target="Pad1995"/> <xref target="Spe"/>. Implementation experience and
   measurements of actual HTTP/1.1 (RFC 2068) implementations show good
   results <xref target="Nie1997"/>. Alternatives have also been explored, for example,
   T/TCP <xref target="Tou1998"/>.
</t>
<t>
   Persistent HTTP connections have a number of advantages:
  <list style="symbols">
      <t>
        By opening and closing fewer TCP connections, CPU time is saved
        in routers and hosts (clients, servers, proxies, gateways,
        tunnels, or caches), and memory used for TCP protocol control
        blocks can be saved in hosts.
      </t>
      <t>
        HTTP requests and responses can be pipelined on a connection.
        Pipelining allows a client to make multiple requests without
        waiting for each response, allowing a single TCP connection to
        be used much more efficiently, with much lower elapsed time.
      </t>
      <t>
        Network congestion is reduced by reducing the number of packets
        caused by TCP opens, and by allowing TCP sufficient time to
        determine the congestion state of the network.
      </t>
      <t>
        Latency on subsequent requests is reduced since there is no time
        spent in TCP's connection opening handshake.
      </t>
      <t>
        HTTP can evolve more gracefully, since errors can be reported
        without the penalty of closing the TCP connection. Clients using
        future versions of HTTP might optimistically try a new feature,
        but if communicating with an older server, retry with old
        semantics after an error is reported.
      </t>
    </list>
</t>
<t>
   HTTP implementations &SHOULD; implement persistent connections.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Overall Operation" anchor="persistent.overall">
<t>
   A significant difference between HTTP/1.1 and earlier versions of
   HTTP is that persistent connections are the default behavior of any
   HTTP connection. That is, unless otherwise indicated, the client
   &SHOULD; assume that the server will maintain a persistent connection,
   even after error responses from the server.
</t>
<t>
   Persistent connections provide a mechanism by which a client and a
   server can signal the close of a TCP connection. This signaling takes
   place using the Connection header field (<xref target="header.connection"/>). Once a close
   has been signaled, the client &MUST-NOT; send any more requests on that
   connection.
</t>

<section title="Negotiation" anchor="persistent.negotiation">
<t>
   An HTTP/1.1 server &MAY; assume that a HTTP/1.1 client intends to
   maintain a persistent connection unless a Connection header including
   the connection-token "close" was sent in the request. If the server
   chooses to close the connection immediately after sending the
   response, it &SHOULD; send a Connection header including the
   connection-token close.
</t>
<t>
   An HTTP/1.1 client &MAY; expect a connection to remain open, but would
   decide to keep it open based on whether the response from a server
   contains a Connection header with the connection-token close. In case
   the client does not want to maintain a connection for more than that
   request, it &SHOULD; send a Connection header including the
   connection-token close.
</t>
<t>
   If either the client or the server sends the close token in the
   Connection header, that request becomes the last one for the
   connection.
</t>
<t>
   Clients and servers &SHOULD-NOT;  assume that a persistent connection is
   maintained for HTTP versions less than 1.1 unless it is explicitly
   signaled. See <xref target="compatibility.with.http.1.0.persistent.connections"/> for more information on backward
   compatibility with HTTP/1.0 clients.
</t>
<t>
   In order to remain persistent, all messages on the connection &MUST;
   have a self-defined message length (i.e., one not defined by closure
   of the connection), as described in <xref target="message.length"/>.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Pipelining" anchor="pipelining">
<t>
   A client that supports persistent connections &MAY; "pipeline" its
   requests (i.e., send multiple requests without waiting for each
   response). A server &MUST; send its responses to those requests in the
   same order that the requests were received.
</t>
<t>
   Clients which assume persistent connections and pipeline immediately
   after connection establishment &SHOULD; be prepared to retry their
   connection if the first pipelined attempt fails. If a client does
   such a retry, it &MUST-NOT; pipeline before it knows the connection is
   persistent. Clients &MUST; also be prepared to resend their requests if
   the server closes the connection before sending all of the
   corresponding responses.
</t>
<t>
   Clients &SHOULD-NOT;  pipeline requests using non-idempotent methods or
   non-idempotent sequences of methods (see <xref target="idempotent.methods"/>). Otherwise, a
   premature termination of the transport connection could lead to
   indeterminate results. A client wishing to send a non-idempotent
   request &SHOULD; wait to send that request until it has received the
   response status for the previous request.
</t>
</section>
</section>

<section title="Proxy Servers" anchor="persistent.proxy">
<t>
   It is especially important that proxies correctly implement the
   properties of the Connection header field as specified in <xref target="header.connection"/>.
</t>
<t>
   The proxy server &MUST; signal persistent connections separately with
   its clients and the origin servers (or other proxy servers) that it
   connects to. Each persistent connection applies to only one transport
   link.
</t>
<t>
   A proxy server &MUST-NOT; establish a HTTP/1.1 persistent connection
   with an HTTP/1.0 client (but see RFC 2068 <xref target="RFC2068"/> for information and
   discussion of the problems with the Keep-Alive header implemented by
   many HTTP/1.0 clients).
</t>
</section>

<section title="Practical Considerations" anchor="persistent.practical">
<t>
   Servers will usually have some time-out value beyond which they will
   no longer maintain an inactive connection. Proxy servers might make
   this a higher value since it is likely that the client will be making
   more connections through the same server. The use of persistent
   connections places no requirements on the length (or existence) of
   this time-out for either the client or the server.
</t>
<t>
   When a client or server wishes to time-out it &SHOULD; issue a graceful
   close on the transport connection. Clients and servers &SHOULD; both
   constantly watch for the other side of the transport close, and
   respond to it as appropriate. If a client or server does not detect
   the other side's close promptly it could cause unnecessary resource
   drain on the network.
</t>
<t>
   A client, server, or proxy &MAY; close the transport connection at any
   time. For example, a client might have started to send a new request
   at the same time that the server has decided to close the "idle"
   connection. From the server's point of view, the connection is being
   closed while it was idle, but from the client's point of view, a
   request is in progress.
</t>
<t>
   This means that clients, servers, and proxies &MUST; be able to recover
   from asynchronous close events. Client software &SHOULD; reopen the
   transport connection and retransmit the aborted sequence of requests
   without user interaction so long as the request sequence is
   idempotent (see <xref target="idempotent.methods"/>). Non-idempotent methods or sequences
   &MUST-NOT; be automatically retried, although user agents &MAY; offer a
   human operator the choice of retrying the request(s). Confirmation by
   user-agent software with semantic understanding of the application
   &MAY; substitute for user confirmation. The automatic retry &SHOULD-NOT; 
   be repeated if the second sequence of requests fails.
</t>
<t>
   Servers &SHOULD; always respond to at least one request per connection,
   if at all possible. Servers &SHOULD-NOT;  close a connection in the
   middle of transmitting a response, unless a network or client failure
   is suspected.
</t>
<t>
   Clients that use persistent connections &SHOULD; limit the number of
   simultaneous connections that they maintain to a given server. A
   single-user client &SHOULD-NOT; maintain more than 2 connections with
   any server or proxy. A proxy &SHOULD; use up to 2*N connections to
   another server or proxy, where N is the number of simultaneously
   active users. These guidelines are intended to improve HTTP response
   times and avoid congestion.
</t>
</section>
</section>

<section title="Message Transmission Requirements" anchor="message.transmission.requirements">

<section title="Persistent Connections and Flow Control" anchor="persistent.flow">
<t>
   HTTP/1.1 servers &SHOULD; maintain persistent connections and use TCP's
   flow control mechanisms to resolve temporary overloads, rather than
   terminating connections with the expectation that clients will retry.
   The latter technique can exacerbate network congestion.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Monitoring Connections for Error Status Messages" anchor="persistent.monitor">
<t>
   An HTTP/1.1 (or later) client sending a message-body &SHOULD; monitor
   the network connection for an error status while it is transmitting
   the request. If the client sees an error status, it &SHOULD;
   immediately cease transmitting the body. If the body is being sent
   using a "chunked" encoding (<xref target="transfer.codings"/>), a zero length chunk and
   empty trailer &MAY; be used to prematurely mark the end of the message.
   If the body was preceded by a Content-Length header, the client &MUST;
   close the connection.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Use of the 100 (Continue) Status" anchor="use.of.the.100.status">
<t>
   The purpose of the <x:ref>100 (Continue)</x:ref> status (see <xref target="status.100"/>) is to
   allow a client that is sending a request message with a request body
   to determine if the origin server is willing to accept the request
   (based on the request headers) before the client sends the request
   body. In some cases, it might either be inappropriate or highly
   inefficient for the client to send the body if the server will reject
   the message without looking at the body.
</t>
<t>
   Requirements for HTTP/1.1 clients:
  <list style="symbols">
    <t>
        If a client will wait for a <x:ref>100 (Continue)</x:ref> response before
        sending the request body, it &MUST; send an Expect request-header
        field (<xref target="header.expect"/>) with the "100-continue" expectation.
    </t>
    <t>
        A client &MUST-NOT; send an Expect request-header field (<xref target="header.expect"/>)
        with the "100-continue" expectation if it does not intend
        to send a request body.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   Because of the presence of older implementations, the protocol allows
   ambiguous situations in which a client may send "Expect: 100-continue"
   without receiving either a <x:ref>417 (Expectation Failed)</x:ref> status
   or a <x:ref>100 (Continue)</x:ref> status. Therefore, when a client sends this
   header field to an origin server (possibly via a proxy) from which it
   has never seen a <x:ref>100 (Continue)</x:ref> status, the client &SHOULD-NOT;  wait
   for an indefinite period before sending the request body.

   Requirements for HTTP/1.1 origin servers:
  <list style="symbols">
    <t> Upon receiving a request which includes an Expect request-header

        from the input stream, or respond with a final status code. The
        origin server &MUST-NOT; wait for the request body before sending
        the <x:ref>100 (Continue)</x:ref> response. If it responds with a final status
        code, it &MAY; close the transport connection or it &MAY; continue
        to read and discard the rest of the request.  It &MUST-NOT;
        perform the requested method if it returns a final status code.
    </t>
    <t> An origin server &SHOULD-NOT;  send a <x:ref>100 (Continue)</x:ref> response if
        the request message does not include an Expect request-header
        field with the "100-continue" expectation, and &MUST-NOT; send a
        <x:ref>100 (Continue)</x:ref> response if such a request comes from an HTTP/1.0
        (or earlier) client. There is an exception to this rule: for
        compatibility with RFC 2068, a server &MAY; send a <x:ref>100 (Continue)</x:ref>
        status in response to an HTTP/1.1 PUT or POST request that does
        not include an Expect request-header field with the "100-continue"
        expectation. This exception, the purpose of which is
        to minimize any client processing delays associated with an
        undeclared wait for <x:ref>100 (Continue)</x:ref> status, applies only to
        HTTP/1.1 requests, and not to requests with any other HTTP-version
        value.
    </t>
    <t> An origin server &MAY; omit a <x:ref>100 (Continue)</x:ref> response if it has
        already received some or all of the request body for the
        corresponding request.
    </t>
    <t> An origin server that sends a <x:ref>100 (Continue)</x:ref> response &MUST;
    ultimately send a final status code, once the request body is
        received and processed, unless it terminates the transport
        connection prematurely.
    </t>
    <t> If an origin server receives a request that does not include an

        from the transport connection, then the server &SHOULD-NOT;  close
        the transport connection until it has read the entire request,
        or until the client closes the connection. Otherwise, the client
        might not reliably receive the response message. However, this

<section title="Safe and Idempotent Methods" anchor="safe.and.idempotent">

<section title="Safe Methods" anchor="safe.methods">
<t>
   Implementors should be aware that the software represents the user in
   their interactions over the Internet, and should be careful to allow
   the user to be aware of any actions they might take which may have an
   unexpected significance to themselves or others.
</t>
<t>
   In particular, the convention has been established that the GET and
   HEAD methods &SHOULD-NOT;  have the significance of taking an action
   other than retrieval. These methods ought to be considered "safe".
   This allows user agents to represent other methods, such as POST, PUT
   and DELETE, in a special way, so that the user is made aware of the
   fact that a possibly unsafe action is being requested.
</t>
<t>
   Naturally, it is not possible to ensure that the server does not
   generate side-effects as a result of performing a GET request; in
   fact, some dynamic resources consider that a feature. The important
   distinction here is that the user did not request the side-effects,
   so therefore cannot be held accountable for them.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Idempotent Methods" anchor="idempotent.methods">
<t>
   Methods can also have the property of "idempotence" in that (aside
   from error or expiration issues) the side-effects of N &gt; 0 identical
   requests is the same as for a single request. The methods GET, HEAD,
   PUT and DELETE share this property. Also, the methods OPTIONS and
   TRACE &SHOULD-NOT;  have side effects, and so are inherently idempotent.
</t>
<t>
   However, it is possible that a sequence of several requests is non-idempotent,
   even if all of the methods executed in that sequence are
   idempotent. (A sequence is idempotent if a single execution of the
   entire sequence always yields a result that is not changed by a
   reexecution of all, or part, of that sequence.) For example, a
   sequence is non-idempotent if its result depends on a value that is
   later modified in the same sequence.
</t>
<t>
   A sequence that never has side effects is idempotent, by definition
   (provided that no concurrent operations are being executed on the

  <iref primary="true" item="OPTIONS method" x:for-anchor=""/>
  <iref primary="true" item="Methods" subitem="OPTIONS" x:for-anchor=""/>
<t>
   The OPTIONS method represents a request for information about the
   communication options available on the request/response chain
   identified by the Request-URI. This method allows the client to
   determine the options and/or requirements associated with a resource,
   or the capabilities of a server, without implying a resource action
   or initiating a resource retrieval.
</t>
<t>
   Responses to this method are not cacheable.
</t>
<t>
   If the OPTIONS request includes an entity-body (as indicated by the
   presence of Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding), then the media type
   &MUST; be indicated by a Content-Type field. Although this
   specification does not define any use for such a body, future
   extensions to HTTP might use the OPTIONS body to make more detailed
   queries on the server. A server that does not support such an
   extension &MAY; discard the request body.
</t>
<t>
   If the Request-URI is an asterisk ("*"), the OPTIONS request is
   intended to apply to the server in general rather than to a specific
   resource. Since a server's communication options typically depend on
   the resource, the "*" request is only useful as a "ping" or "no-op"
   type of method; it does nothing beyond allowing the client to test
   the capabilities of the server. For example, this can be used to test
   a proxy for HTTP/1.1 compliance (or lack thereof).
</t>
<t>
   If the Request-URI is not an asterisk, the OPTIONS request applies
   only to the options that are available when communicating with that
   resource.
</t>
<t>
   A 200 response &SHOULD; include any header fields that indicate
   optional features implemented by the server and applicable to that
   resource (e.g., Allow), possibly including extensions not defined by
   this specification. The response body, if any, &SHOULD; also include
   information about the communication options. The format for such a
   body is not defined by this specification, but might be defined by
   future extensions to HTTP. Content negotiation &MAY; be used to select
   the appropriate response format. If no response body is included, the
   response &MUST; include a Content-Length field with a field-value of
   "0".
</t>
<t>
   The Max-Forwards request-header field &MAY; be used to target a
   specific proxy in the request chain. When a proxy receives an OPTIONS
   request on an absoluteURI for which request forwarding is permitted,
   the proxy &MUST; check for a Max-Forwards field. If the Max-Forwards
   field-value is zero ("0"), the proxy &MUST-NOT; forward the message;
   instead, the proxy &SHOULD; respond with its own communication options.
   If the Max-Forwards field-value is an integer greater than zero, the
   proxy &MUST; decrement the field-value when it forwards the request. If
   no Max-Forwards field is present in the request, then the forwarded
   request &MUST-NOT; include a Max-Forwards field.

<t>
   The GET method means retrieve whatever information (in the form of an
   entity) is identified by the Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers
   to a data-producing process, it is the produced data which shall be
   returned as the entity in the response and not the source text of the
   process, unless that text happens to be the output of the process.
</t>
<t>
   The semantics of the GET method change to a "conditional GET" if the
   request message includes an If-Modified-Since, If-Unmodified-Since,
   If-Match, If-None-Match, or If-Range header field. A conditional GET
   method requests that the entity be transferred only under the
   circumstances described by the conditional header field(s). The
   conditional GET method is intended to reduce unnecessary network
   usage by allowing cached entities to be refreshed without requiring
   multiple requests or transferring data already held by the client.
</t>
<t>
   The semantics of the GET method change to a "partial GET" if the
   request message includes a Range header field. A partial GET requests
   that only part of the entity be transferred, as described in <xref target="header.range"/>.
   The partial GET method is intended to reduce unnecessary
   network usage by allowing partially-retrieved entities to be
   completed without transferring data already held by the client.

  <iref primary="true" item="Methods" subitem="HEAD" x:for-anchor=""/>
<t>
   The HEAD method is identical to GET except that the server &MUST-NOT;
   return a message-body in the response. The metainformation contained
   in the HTTP headers in response to a HEAD request &SHOULD; be identical
   to the information sent in response to a GET request. This method can
   be used for obtaining metainformation about the entity implied by the
   request without transferring the entity-body itself. This method is
   often used for testing hypertext links for validity, accessibility,
   and recent modification.
</t>
<t>
   The response to a HEAD request &MAY; be cacheable in the sense that the
   information contained in the response &MAY; be used to update a
   previously cached entity from that resource. If the new field values
   indicate that the cached entity differs from the current entity (as
   would be indicated by a change in Content-Length, Content-MD5, ETag
   or Last-Modified), then the cache &MUST; treat the cache entry as
   stale.

<section title="POST" anchor="POST">
  <iref primary="true" item="POST method" x:for-anchor=""/>
  <iref primary="true" item="Methods" subitem="POST" x:for-anchor=""/>
<t>
   The POST method is used to request that the origin server accept the
   entity enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the resource
   identified by the Request-URI in the Request-Line. POST is designed
   to allow a uniform method to cover the following functions:
  <list style="symbols">
    <t>
      Annotation of existing resources;
    </t>
    <t>
        Posting a message to a bulletin board, newsgroup, mailing list,
        or similar group of articles;
    </t>
    <t>
        Providing a block of data, such as the result of submitting a
        form, to a data-handling process;
    </t>
    <t>
        Extending a database through an append operation.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   The actual function performed by the POST method is determined by the
   server and is usually dependent on the Request-URI. The posted entity
   is subordinate to that URI in the same way that a file is subordinate
   to a directory containing it, a news article is subordinate to a
   newsgroup to which it is posted, or a record is subordinate to a
   database.
</t>
<t>
   The action performed by the POST method might not result in a
   resource that can be identified by a URI. In this case, either <x:ref>200 (OK)</x:ref>
   or <x:ref>204 (No Content)</x:ref> is the appropriate response status,
   depending on whether or not the response includes an entity that
   describes the result.
</t>
<t>
   If a resource has been created on the origin server, the response
   &SHOULD; be <x:ref>201 (Created)</x:ref> and contain an entity which describes the
   status of the request and refers to the new resource, and a Location
   header (see <xref target="header.location"/>).
</t>
<t>
   Responses to this method are not cacheable, unless the response
   includes appropriate Cache-Control or Expires header fields. However,
   the <x:ref>303 (See Other)</x:ref> response can be used to direct the user agent to
   retrieve a cacheable resource.
</t>
<t>
   POST requests &MUST; obey the message transmission requirements set out
   in <xref target="message.transmission.requirements"/>.
</t>
<t>
   See <xref target="encoding.sensitive.information.in.uris"/> for security considerations.

</section>

<section title="PUT" anchor="PUT">
  <iref primary="true" item="PUT method" x:for-anchor=""/>
  <iref primary="true" item="Methods" subitem="PUT" x:for-anchor=""/>
<t>
   The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the
   supplied Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers to an already
   existing resource, the enclosed entity &SHOULD; be considered as a
   modified version of the one residing on the origin server. If the
   Request-URI does not point to an existing resource, and that URI is
   capable of being defined as a new resource by the requesting user
   agent, the origin server can create the resource with that URI. If a
   new resource is created, the origin server &MUST; inform the user agent
   via the <x:ref>201 (Created)</x:ref> response. If an existing resource is modified,
   either the <x:ref>200 (OK)</x:ref> or <x:ref>204 (No Content)</x:ref> response codes &SHOULD; be sent
   to indicate successful completion of the request. If the resource
   could not be created or modified with the Request-URI, an appropriate
   error response &SHOULD; be given that reflects the nature of the
   problem. The recipient of the entity &MUST-NOT; ignore any Content-*
   (e.g. Content-Range) headers that it does not understand or implement
   and &MUST; return a <x:ref>501 (Not Implemented)</x:ref> response in such cases.
</t>
<t>
   If the request passes through a cache and the Request-URI identifies
   one or more currently cached entities, those entries &SHOULD; be
   treated as stale. Responses to this method are not cacheable.
</t>
<t>
   The fundamental difference between the POST and PUT requests is
   reflected in the different meaning of the Request-URI. The URI in a
   POST request identifies the resource that will handle the enclosed
   entity. That resource might be a data-accepting process, a gateway to
   some other protocol, or a separate entity that accepts annotations.
   In contrast, the URI in a PUT request identifies the entity enclosed
   with the request -- the user agent knows what URI is intended and the
   server &MUST-NOT; attempt to apply the request to some other resource.
   If the server desires that the request be applied to a different URI,
   it &MUST; send a <x:ref>301 (Moved Permanently)</x:ref> response; the user agent &MAY;
   then make its own decision regarding whether or not to redirect the
   request.
</t>
<t>
   A single resource &MAY; be identified by many different URIs. For
   example, an article might have a URI for identifying "the current
   version" which is separate from the URI identifying each particular
   version. In this case, a PUT request on a general URI might result in
   several other URIs being defined by the origin server.
</t>
<t>
   HTTP/1.1 does not define how a PUT method affects the state of an
   origin server.
</t>
<t>
   PUT requests &MUST; obey the message transmission requirements set out
   in <xref target="message.transmission.requirements"/>.
</t>
<t>
   Unless otherwise specified for a particular entity-header, the
   entity-headers in the PUT request &SHOULD; be applied to the resource
   created or modified by the PUT.
</t>

<section title="DELETE" anchor="DELETE">
  <iref primary="true" item="DELETE method" x:for-anchor=""/>
  <iref primary="true" item="Methods" subitem="DELETE" x:for-anchor=""/>
<t>
   The DELETE method requests that the origin server delete the resource
   identified by the Request-URI. This method &MAY; be overridden by human
   intervention (or other means) on the origin server. The client cannot
   be guaranteed that the operation has been carried out, even if the
   status code returned from the origin server indicates that the action
   has been completed successfully. However, the server &SHOULD-NOT; 
   indicate success unless, at the time the response is given, it
   intends to delete the resource or move it to an inaccessible
   location.
</t>
<t>
   A successful response &SHOULD; be <x:ref>200 (OK)</x:ref> if the response includes an
   entity describing the status, <x:ref>202 (Accepted)</x:ref> if the action has not
   yet been enacted, or <x:ref>204 (No Content)</x:ref> if the action has been enacted
   but the response does not include an entity.
</t>
<t>
   If the request passes through a cache and the Request-URI identifies
   one or more currently cached entities, those entries &SHOULD; be
   treated as stale. Responses to this method are not cacheable.

<section title="TRACE" anchor="TRACE">
  <iref primary="true" item="TRACE method" x:for-anchor=""/>
  <iref primary="true" item="Methods" subitem="TRACE" x:for-anchor=""/>
<t>
   The TRACE method is used to invoke a remote, application-layer loop-back
   of the request message. The final recipient of the request
   &SHOULD; reflect the message received back to the client as the
   entity-body of a <x:ref>200 (OK)</x:ref> response. The final recipient is either the
   origin server or the first proxy or gateway to receive a Max-Forwards
   value of zero (0) in the request (see <xref target="header.max-forwards"/>). A TRACE request
   &MUST-NOT; include an entity.
</t>
<t>
   TRACE allows the client to see what is being received at the other
   end of the request chain and use that data for testing or diagnostic
   information. The value of the Via header field (<xref target="header.via"/>) is of
   particular interest, since it acts as a trace of the request chain.
   Use of the Max-Forwards header field allows the client to limit the
   length of the request chain, which is useful for testing a chain of
   proxies forwarding messages in an infinite loop.
</t>
<t>
   If the request is valid, the response &SHOULD; contain the entire
   request message in the entity-body, with a Content-Type of
   "message/http". Responses to this method &MUST-NOT; be cached.
</t>

<section title="Status Code Definitions" anchor="status.codes">
<t>
   Each Status-Code is described below, including a description of which
   method(s) it can follow and any metainformation required in the
   response.
</t>

<section title="Informational 1xx" anchor="status.1xx">
<t>
   This class of status code indicates a provisional response,
   consisting only of the Status-Line and optional headers, and is
   terminated by an empty line. There are no required headers for this
   class of status code. Since HTTP/1.0 did not define any 1xx status
   codes, servers &MUST-NOT; send a 1xx response to an HTTP/1.0 client
   except under experimental conditions.
</t>
<t>
   A client &MUST; be prepared to accept one or more 1xx status responses
   prior to a regular response, even if the client does not expect a <x:ref>100 (Continue)</x:ref>
   status message. Unexpected 1xx status responses &MAY; be
   ignored by a user agent.
</t>
<t>
   Proxies &MUST; forward 1xx responses, unless the connection between the
   proxy and its client has been closed, or unless the proxy itself
   requested the generation of the 1xx response. (For example, if a
   proxy adds a "Expect: 100-continue" field when it forwards a request,
   then it need not forward the corresponding <x:ref>100 (Continue)</x:ref>
   response(s).)
</t>

<section title="100 Continue" anchor="status.100">
  <iref primary="true" item="100 Continue (status code)" x:for-anchor=""/>
  <iref primary="true" item="Status Codes" subitem="100 Continue" x:for-anchor=""/>
  <x:anchor-alias value="100 (Continue)"/>
  <x:anchor-alias value="100 (continue)"/>
<t>
   The client &SHOULD; continue with its request. This interim response is
   used to inform the client that the initial part of the request has
   been received and has not yet been rejected by the server. The client
   &SHOULD; continue by sending the remainder of the request or, if the
   request has already been completed, ignore this response. The server
   &MUST; send a final response after the request has been completed. See
   <xref target="use.of.the.100.status"/> for detailed discussion of the use and handling of this
   status code.
</t>
</section>

<section title="101 Switching Protocols" anchor="status.101">
  <iref primary="true" item="101 Switching Protocols (status code)" x:for-anchor=""/>
  <iref primary="true" item="Status Codes" subitem="101 Switching Protocols" x:for-anchor=""/>
  <x:anchor-alias value="101 (Switching Protocols)"/>
<t>
   The server understands and is willing to comply with the client's
   request, via the Upgrade message header field (<xref target="header.upgrade"/>), for a
   change in the application protocol being used on this connection. The
   server will switch protocols to those defined by the response's
   Upgrade header field immediately after the empty line which
   terminates the 101 response.
</t>
<t>
   The protocol &SHOULD; be switched only when it is advantageous to do
   so. For example, switching to a newer version of HTTP is advantageous
   over older versions, and switching to a real-time, synchronous
   protocol might be advantageous when delivering resources that use
   such features.
</t>
</section>
</section>

<section title="Successful 2xx" anchor="status.2xx">
<t>
   This class of status code indicates that the client's request was

   The request has succeeded. The information returned with the response
   is dependent on the method used in the request, for example:
  <list style="hanging">
    <t hangText="GET">
          an entity corresponding to the requested resource is sent in
          the response;
    </t>
    <t hangText="HEAD">
          the entity-header fields corresponding to the requested
          resource are sent in the response without any message-body;
    </t>
    <t hangText="POST">
      an entity describing or containing the result of the action;
    </t>

  <iref primary="true" item="Status Codes" subitem="201 Created" x:for-anchor=""/>
  <x:anchor-alias value="201 (Created)"/>
<t>
   The request has been fulfilled and resulted in a new resource being
   created. The newly created resource can be referenced by the URI(s)
   returned in the entity of the response, with the most specific URI
   for the resource given by a Location header field. The response
   &SHOULD; include an entity containing a list of resource
   characteristics and location(s) from which the user or user agent can
   choose the one most appropriate. The entity format is specified by
   the media type given in the Content-Type header field. The origin
   server &MUST; create the resource before returning the 201 status code.
   If the action cannot be carried out immediately, the server &SHOULD;
   respond with <x:ref>202 (Accepted)</x:ref> response instead.
</t>
<t>
   A 201 response &MAY; contain an ETag response header field indicating
   the current value of the entity tag for the requested variant just
   created, see <xref target="header.etag"/>.
</t>
</section>

<section title="202 Accepted" anchor="status.202">
  <iref primary="true" item="202 Accepted (status code)" x:for-anchor=""/>
  <iref primary="true" item="Status Codes" subitem="202 Accepted" x:for-anchor=""/>
  <x:anchor-alias value="202 (Accepted)"/>
<t>
   The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has
   not been completed.  The request might or might not eventually be
   acted upon, as it might be disallowed when processing actually takes
   place. There is no facility for re-sending a status code from an
   asynchronous operation such as this.
</t>
<t>
   The 202 response is intentionally non-committal. Its purpose is to
   allow a server to accept a request for some other process (perhaps a
   batch-oriented process that is only run once per day) without
   requiring that the user agent's connection to the server persist
   until the process is completed. The entity returned with this
   response &SHOULD; include an indication of the request's current status
   and either a pointer to a status monitor or some estimate of when the
   user can expect the request to be fulfilled.
</t>

  <iref primary="true" item="Status Codes" subitem="203 Non-Authoritative Information" x:for-anchor=""/>
<t>
   The returned metainformation in the entity-header is not the
   definitive set as available from the origin server, but is gathered
   from a local or a third-party copy. The set presented &MAY; be a subset
   or superset of the original version. For example, including local
   annotation information about the resource might result in a superset
   of the metainformation known by the origin server. Use of this
   response code is not required and is only appropriate when the
   response would otherwise be <x:ref>200 (OK)</x:ref>.
</t>
</section>

<section title="204 No Content" anchor="status.204">
  <iref primary="true" item="204 No Content (status code)" x:for-anchor=""/>

  <x:anchor-alias value="204 (No Content)"/>
  <x:anchor-alias value="204 (no content)"/>
<t>
   The server has fulfilled the request but does not need to return an
   entity-body, and might want to return updated metainformation. The
   response &MAY; include new or updated metainformation in the form of
   entity-headers, which if present &SHOULD; be associated with the
   requested variant.
</t>
<t>
   If the client is a user agent, it &SHOULD-NOT;  change its document view
   from that which caused the request to be sent. This response is
   primarily intended to allow input for actions to take place without
   causing a change to the user agent's active document view, although
   any new or updated metainformation &SHOULD; be applied to the document
   currently in the user agent's active view.
</t>
<t>
   The 204 response &MUST-NOT; include a message-body, and thus is always
   terminated by the first empty line after the header fields.

<t>
   The server has fulfilled the request and the user agent &SHOULD; reset
   the document view which caused the request to be sent. This response
   is primarily intended to allow input for actions to take place via
   user input, followed by a clearing of the form in which the input is
   given so that the user can easily initiate another input action. The
   response &MUST-NOT; include an entity.

   The server has fulfilled the partial GET request for the resource.
   The request &MUST; have included a Range header field (<xref target="header.range"/>)
   indicating the desired range, and &MAY; have included an If-Range
   header field (<xref target="header.if-range"/>) to make the request conditional.
</t>

   The response &MUST; include the following header fields:
  <list style="symbols">

        Either a Content-Range header field (<xref target="header.content-range"/>) indicating
        the range included with this response, or a multipart/byteranges

<t>
   If the 206 response is the result of an If-Range request that used a
   strong cache validator (see <xref target="weak.and.strong.validators"/>), the response &SHOULD-NOT; 
   include other entity-headers. If the response is the result of an
   If-Range request that used a weak validator, the response &MUST-NOT;
   include other entity-headers; this prevents inconsistencies between
   cached entity-bodies and updated headers. Otherwise, the response

   The response to the request can be found under a different URI and

<t>
   The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current
   state of the resource. This code is only allowed in situations where
   it is expected that the user might be able to resolve the conflict
   and resubmit the request. The response body &SHOULD; include enough
   information for the user to recognize the source of the conflict.
   Ideally, the response entity would include enough information for the
   user or user agent to fix the problem; however, that might not be
   possible and is not required.

   Conflicts are most likely to occur in response to a PUT request. For
   example, if versioning were being used and the entity being PUT
   included changes to a resource which conflict with those made by an
   earlier (third-party) request, the server might use the 409 response
   to indicate that it can't complete the request. In this case, the
   response entity would likely contain a list of the differences
   between the two versions in a format defined by the response
   Content-Type.

</t>
<t>
   The 410 response is primarily intended to assist the task of web
   maintenance by notifying the recipient that the resource is
   intentionally unavailable and that the server owners desire that
   remote links to that resource be removed. Such an event is common for
   limited-time, promotional services and for resources belonging to
   individuals no longer working at the server's site. It is not
   necessary to mark all permanently unavailable resources as "gone" or
   to keep the mark for any length of time -- that is left to the

   using the same major version as the client, as described in <xref target="http.version"/>,
   other than with this error message. The response &SHOULD; contain
   an entity describing why that version is not supported and what other
   protocols are supported by that server.

<section title="Access Authentication" anchor="access.authentication">
<t>
   HTTP provides several &OPTIONAL; challenge-response authentication

   mechanisms which can be used by a server to challenge a client
   request and by a client to provide authentication information. The
   general framework for access authentication, and the specification of
   "basic" and "digest" authentication, are specified in "HTTP
   Authentication: Basic and Digest Access Authentication" <xref target="RFC2617"/>. This
   specification adopts the definitions of "challenge" and "credentials"
   from that specification.

<section title="Content Negotiation" anchor="content.negotiation">
<t>
   Most HTTP responses include an entity which contains information for
   interpretation by a human user. Naturally, it is desirable to supply
   the user with the "best available" entity corresponding to the
   request. Unfortunately for servers and caches, not all users have the
   same preferences for what is "best," and not all user agents are
   equally capable of rendering all entity types. For that reason, HTTP
   has provisions for several mechanisms for "content negotiation" --
   the process of selecting the best representation for a given response
   when there are multiple representations available.
  <list><t>
      <x:h>Note:</x:h> This is not called "format negotiation" because the
      alternate representations may be of the same media type, but use
      different capabilities of that type, be in different languages,
      etc.
  </t></list>
</t>
<t>
   Any response containing an entity-body &MAY; be subject to negotiation,
   including error responses.
</t>
<t>
   There are two kinds of content negotiation which are possible in
   HTTP: server-driven and agent-driven negotiation. These two kinds of
   negotiation are orthogonal and thus may be used separately or in
   combination. One method of combination, referred to as transparent
   negotiation, occurs when a cache uses the agent-driven negotiation
   information provided by the origin server in order to provide
   server-driven negotiation for subsequent requests.
</t>

<section title="Server-driven Negotiation" anchor="server-driven.negotiation">
<t>
   If the selection of the best representation for a response is made by
   an algorithm located at the server, it is called server-driven
   negotiation. Selection is based on the available representations of
   the response (the dimensions over which it can vary; e.g. language,
   content-coding, etc.) and the contents of particular header fields in
   the request message or on other information pertaining to the request
   (such as the network address of the client).
</t>
<t>
   Server-driven negotiation is advantageous when the algorithm for
   selecting from among the available representations is difficult to
   describe to the user agent, or when the server desires to send its
   "best guess" to the client along with the first response (hoping to
   avoid the round-trip delay of a subsequent request if the "best
   guess" is good enough for the user). In order to improve the server's
   guess, the user agent &MAY; include request header fields (Accept,
   Accept-Language, Accept-Encoding, etc.) which describe its
   preferences for such a response.
</t>
<t>
   Server-driven negotiation has disadvantages:
  <list style="numbers">
    <t>
         It is impossible for the server to accurately determine what
         might be "best" for any given user, since that would require
         complete knowledge of both the capabilities of the user agent
         and the intended use for the response (e.g., does the user want
         to view it on screen or print it on paper?).
    </t>
    <t>
         Having the user agent describe its capabilities in every
         request can be both very inefficient (given that only a small
         percentage of responses have multiple representations) and a
         potential violation of the user's privacy.
    </t>
    <t>
         It complicates the implementation of an origin server and the
         algorithms for generating responses to a request.
    </t>
    <t>
         It may limit a public cache's ability to use the same response
         for multiple user's requests.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   HTTP/1.1 includes the following request-header fields for enabling
   server-driven negotiation through description of user agent
   capabilities and user preferences: Accept (<xref target="header.accept"/>), Accept-Charset
   (<xref target="header.accept-charset"/>), Accept-Encoding (<xref target="header.accept-encoding"/>), Accept-Language
   (<xref target="header.accept-language"/>), and User-Agent (<xref target="header.user-agent"/>). However, an
   origin server is not limited to these dimensions and &MAY; vary the
   response based on any aspect of the request, including information
   outside the request-header fields or within extension header fields
   not defined by this specification.
</t>
<t>
   The Vary  header field can be used to express the parameters the
   server uses to select a representation that is subject to server-driven
   negotiation. See <xref target="caching.negotiated.responses"/> for use of the Vary header field
   by caches and <xref target="header.vary"/> for use of the Vary header field by
   servers.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Agent-driven Negotiation" anchor="agent-driven.negotiation">
<t>
   With agent-driven negotiation, selection of the best representation
   for a response is performed by the user agent after receiving an
   initial response from the origin server. Selection is based on a list
   of the available representations of the response included within the
   header fields or entity-body of the initial response, with each
   representation identified by its own URI. Selection from among the
   representations may be performed automatically (if the user agent is
   capable of doing so) or manually by the user selecting from a
   generated (possibly hypertext) menu.
</t>
<t>
   Agent-driven negotiation is advantageous when the response would vary
   over commonly-used dimensions (such as type, language, or encoding),
   when the origin server is unable to determine a user agent's
   capabilities from examining the request, and generally when public
   caches are used to distribute server load and reduce network usage.
</t>
<t>
   Agent-driven negotiation suffers from the disadvantage of needing a
   second request to obtain the best alternate representation. This
   second request is only efficient when caching is used. In addition,
   this specification does not define any mechanism for supporting
   automatic selection, though it also does not prevent any such
   mechanism from being developed as an extension and used within
   HTTP/1.1.
</t>
<t>
   HTTP/1.1 defines the <x:ref>300 (Multiple Choices)</x:ref> and <x:ref>406 (Not Acceptable)</x:ref>
   status codes for enabling agent-driven negotiation when the server is
   unwilling or unable to provide a varying response using server-driven
   negotiation.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Transparent Negotiation" anchor="transparent.negotiation">
<t>
   Transparent negotiation is a combination of both server-driven and
   agent-driven negotiation. When a cache is supplied with a form of the
   list of available representations of the response (as in agent-driven
   negotiation) and the dimensions of variance are completely understood
   by the cache, then the cache becomes capable of performing server-driven
   negotiation on behalf of the origin server for subsequent
   requests on that resource.
</t>
<t>
   Transparent negotiation has the advantage of distributing the
   negotiation work that would otherwise be required of the origin
   server and also removing the second request delay of agent-driven
   negotiation when the cache is able to correctly guess the right
   response.
</t>
<t>
   This specification does not define any mechanism for transparent
   negotiation, though it also does not prevent any such mechanism from
   being developed as an extension that could be used within HTTP/1.1.

<section title="Caching in HTTP" anchor="caching">

<t>
   HTTP is typically used for distributed information systems, where
   performance can be improved by the use of response caches. The
   HTTP/1.1 protocol includes a number of elements intended to make
   caching work as well as possible. Because these elements are
   inextricable from other aspects of the protocol, and because they
   interact with each other, it is useful to describe the basic caching
   design of HTTP separately from the detailed descriptions of methods,
   headers, response codes, etc.
</t>
<t>
   Caching would be useless if it did not significantly improve
   performance. The goal of caching in HTTP/1.1 is to eliminate the need
   to send requests in many cases, and to eliminate the need to send
   full responses in many other cases. The former reduces the number of
   network round-trips required for many operations; we use an
   "expiration" mechanism for this purpose (see <xref target="expiration.model"/>). The
   latter reduces network bandwidth requirements; we use a "validation"
   mechanism for this purpose (see <xref target="validation.model"/>).
</t>
<t>
   Requirements for performance, availability, and disconnected
   operation require us to be able to relax the goal of semantic
   transparency. The HTTP/1.1 protocol allows origin servers, caches,
   and clients to explicitly reduce transparency when necessary.
   However, because non-transparent operation may confuse non-expert
   users, and might be incompatible with certain server applications
   (such as those for ordering merchandise), the protocol requires that
   transparency be relaxed
  <list style="symbols">
     <t>only by an explicit protocol-level request when relaxed by
        client or origin server</t>

     <t>only with an explicit warning to the end user when relaxed by
        cache or client</t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   Therefore, the HTTP/1.1 protocol provides these important elements:
  <list style="numbers">
      <t>Protocol features that provide full semantic transparency when
         this is required by all parties.</t>

      <t>Protocol features that allow an origin server or user agent to
         explicitly request and control non-transparent operation.</t>

      <t>Protocol features that allow a cache to attach warnings to
         responses that do not preserve the requested approximation of
         semantic transparency.</t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   A basic principle is that it must be possible for the clients to
   detect any potential relaxation of semantic transparency.
  <list><t>
      <x:h>Note:</x:h> The server, cache, or client implementor might be faced with
      design decisions not explicitly discussed in this specification.
      If a decision might affect semantic transparency, the implementor
      ought to err on the side of maintaining transparency unless a
      careful and complete analysis shows significant benefits in
      breaking transparency.
    </t></list>
</t>

<section title="">

<section title="Cache Correctness" anchor="cache.correctness">
<t>
   A correct cache &MUST; respond to a request with the most up-to-date
   response held by the cache that is appropriate to the request (see
   sections <xref target="disambiguating.expiration.values" format="counter"/>,
   <xref target="disambiguating.multiple.responses" format="counter"/>,
   and <xref target="cache.replacement" format="counter"/>) which meets one of the following
   conditions:
  <list style="numbers">
      <t>It has been checked for equivalence with what the origin server
         would have returned by revalidating the response with the
         origin server (<xref target="validation.model"/>);</t>

      <t>It is "fresh enough" (see <xref target="expiration.model"/>). In the default case,
         this means it meets the least restrictive freshness requirement
         of the client, origin server, and cache (see <xref target="header.cache-control"/>); if
         the origin server so specifies, it is the freshness requirement
         of the origin server alone.

         If a stored response is not "fresh enough" by the most
         restrictive freshness requirement of both the client and the
         origin server, in carefully considered circumstances the cache
         &MAY; still return the response with the appropriate Warning
         header (see section <xref target="exceptions.to.the.rules.and.warnings" format="counter"/>
         and <xref target="header.warning" format="counter"/>), unless such a response
         is prohibited (e.g., by a "no-store" cache-directive, or by a
         "no-cache" cache-request-directive; see <xref target="header.cache-control"/>).</t>

      <t>It is an appropriate <x:ref>304 (Not Modified)</x:ref>, <x:ref>305 (Proxy Redirect)</x:ref>,
         or error (4xx or 5xx) response message.</t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   If the cache can not communicate with the origin server, then a
   correct cache &SHOULD; respond as above if the response can be
   correctly served from the cache; if not it &MUST; return an error or
   warning indicating that there was a communication failure.
</t>
<t>
   If a cache receives a response (either an entire response, or a 304
   (Not Modified) response) that it would normally forward to the
   requesting client, and the received response is no longer fresh, the
   cache &SHOULD; forward it to the requesting client without adding a new
   Warning (but without removing any existing Warning headers). A cache
   &SHOULD-NOT;  attempt to revalidate a response simply because that
   response became stale in transit; this might lead to an infinite
   loop. A user agent that receives a stale response without a Warning
   &MAY; display a warning indication to the user.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Warnings" anchor="warnings">
<t>
   Whenever a cache returns a response that is neither first-hand nor
   "fresh enough" (in the sense of condition 2 in <xref target="cache.correctness"/>), it
   &MUST; attach a warning to that effect, using a Warning general-header.
   The Warning header and the currently defined warnings are described
   in <xref target="header.warning"/>. The warning allows clients to take appropriate
   action.
</t>
<t>
   Warnings &MAY; be used for other purposes, both cache-related and
   otherwise. The use of a warning, rather than an error status code,
   distinguish these responses from true failures.
</t>
<t>
   Warnings are assigned three digit warn-codes. The first digit
   indicates whether the Warning &MUST; or &MUST-NOT; be deleted from a
   stored cache entry after a successful revalidation:
</t>
<t>
  <list style="hanging">
    <t hangText="1xx">Warnings that describe the freshness or revalidation status of
     the response, and so &MUST; be deleted after a successful
     revalidation. 1XX warn-codes &MAY; be generated by a cache only when
     validating a cached entry. It &MUST-NOT; be generated by clients.</t>

    <t hangText="2xx">Warnings that describe some aspect of the entity body or entity
     headers that is not rectified by a revalidation (for example, a
     lossy compression of the entity bodies) and which &MUST-NOT; be
     deleted after a successful revalidation.</t>
    </list>
</t>
<t>
   See <xref target="header.warning"/> for the definitions of the codes themselves.
</t>
<t>
   HTTP/1.0 caches will cache all Warnings in responses, without
   deleting the ones in the first category. Warnings in responses that
   are passed to HTTP/1.0 caches carry an extra warning-date field,
   which prevents a future HTTP/1.1 recipient from believing an
   erroneously cached Warning.
</t>
<t>
   Warnings also carry a warning text. The text &MAY; be in any
   appropriate natural language (perhaps based on the client's Accept
   headers), and include an &OPTIONAL; indication of what character set is
   used.
</t>
<t>
   Multiple warnings &MAY; be attached to a response (either by the origin
   server or by a cache), including multiple warnings with the same code
   number. For example, a server might provide the same warning with
   texts in both English and Basque.
</t>
<t>
   When multiple warnings are attached to a response, it might not be
   practical or reasonable to display all of them to the user. This
   version of HTTP does not specify strict priority rules for deciding
   which warnings to display and in what order, but does suggest some
   heuristics.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Cache-control Mechanisms" anchor="cache-control.mechanisms">
<t>
   The basic cache mechanisms in HTTP/1.1 (server-specified expiration
   times and validators) are implicit directives to caches. In some
   cases, a server or client might need to provide explicit directives
   to the HTTP caches. We use the Cache-Control header for this purpose.
</t>
<t>
   The Cache-Control header allows a client or server to transmit a
   variety of directives in either requests or responses. These
   directives typically override the default caching algorithms. As a
   general rule, if there is any apparent conflict between header
   values, the most restrictive interpretation is applied (that is, the
   one that is most likely to preserve semantic transparency). However,
   in some cases, cache-control directives are explicitly specified as
   weakening the approximation of semantic transparency (for example,
   "max-stale" or "public").
</t>
<t>
   The cache-control directives are described in detail in <xref target="header.cache-control"/>.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Explicit User Agent Warnings" anchor="explicit.ua.warnings">
<t>
   Many user agents make it possible for users to override the basic
   caching mechanisms. For example, the user agent might allow the user
   to specify that cached entities (even explicitly stale ones) are
   never validated. Or the user agent might habitually add "Cache-Control:
   max-stale=3600" to every request. The user agent &SHOULD-NOT; 
   default to either non-transparent behavior, or behavior that results
   in abnormally ineffective caching, but &MAY; be explicitly configured
   to do so by an explicit action of the user.
</t>
<t>
   If the user has overridden the basic caching mechanisms, the user
   agent &SHOULD; explicitly indicate to the user whenever this results in
   the display of information that might not meet the server's
   transparency requirements (in particular, if the displayed entity is
   known to be stale). Since the protocol normally allows the user agent
   to determine if responses are stale or not, this indication need only
   be displayed when this actually happens. The indication need not be a
   dialog box; it could be an icon (for example, a picture of a rotting
   fish) or some other indicator.
</t>
<t>
   If the user has overridden the caching mechanisms in a way that would
   abnormally reduce the effectiveness of caches, the user agent &SHOULD;
   continually indicate this state to the user (for example, by a
   display of a picture of currency in flames) so that the user does not
   inadvertently consume excess resources or suffer from excessive
   latency.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Exceptions to the Rules and Warnings" anchor="exceptions.to.the.rules.and.warnings">
<t>
   In some cases, the operator of a cache &MAY; choose to configure it to
   return stale responses even when not requested by clients. This
   decision ought not be made lightly, but may be necessary for reasons
   of availability or performance, especially when the cache is poorly
   connected to the origin server. Whenever a cache returns a stale
   response, it &MUST; mark it as such (using a Warning header) enabling
   the client software to alert the user that there might be a potential
   problem.
</t>
<t>
   It also allows the user agent to take steps to obtain a first-hand or
   fresh response. For this reason, a cache &SHOULD-NOT;  return a stale
   response if the client explicitly requests a first-hand or fresh one,
   unless it is impossible to comply for technical or policy reasons.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Client-controlled Behavior" anchor="client-controlled.behavior">
<t>
   While the origin server (and to a lesser extent, intermediate caches,
   by their contribution to the age of a response) are the primary
   source of expiration information, in some cases the client might need
   to control a cache's decision about whether to return a cached
   response without validating it. Clients do this using several
   directives of the Cache-Control header.
</t>
<t>
   A client's request &MAY; specify the maximum age it is willing to
   accept of an unvalidated response; specifying a value of zero forces
   the cache(s) to revalidate all responses. A client &MAY; also specify
   the minimum time remaining before a response expires. Both of these
   options increase constraints on the behavior of caches, and so cannot
   further relax the cache's approximation of semantic transparency.
</t>
<t>
   A client &MAY; also specify that it will accept stale responses, up to
   some maximum amount of staleness. This loosens the constraints on the
   caches, and so might violate the origin server's specified
   constraints on semantic transparency, but might be necessary to
   support disconnected operation, or high availability in the face of
   poor connectivity.
</t>
</section>
</section>

<section title="Expiration Model" anchor="expiration.model">

<section title="Server-Specified Expiration" anchor="server-specified.expiration">
<t>
   HTTP caching works best when caches can entirely avoid making
   requests to the origin server. The primary mechanism for avoiding
   requests is for an origin server to provide an explicit expiration
   time in the future, indicating that a response &MAY; be used to satisfy
   subsequent requests. In other words, a cache can return a fresh
   response without first contacting the server.
</t>
<t>
   Our expectation is that servers will assign future explicit
   expiration times to responses in the belief that the entity is not
   likely to change, in a semantically significant way, before the
   expiration time is reached. This normally preserves semantic
   transparency, as long as the server's expiration times are carefully
   chosen.
</t>
<t>
   The expiration mechanism applies only to responses taken from a cache
   and not to first-hand responses forwarded immediately to the
   requesting client.
</t>
<t>
   If an origin server wishes to force a semantically transparent cache
   to validate every request, it &MAY; assign an explicit expiration time
   in the past. This means that the response is always stale, and so the
   cache &SHOULD; validate it before using it for subsequent requests. See
   <xref target="cache.revalidation.and.reload.controls"/> for a more restrictive way to force revalidation.
</t>
<t>
   If an origin server wishes to force any HTTP/1.1 cache, no matter how
   it is configured, to validate every request, it &SHOULD; use the "must-revalidate"
   cache-control directive (see <xref target="header.cache-control"/>).
</t>
<t>
   Servers specify explicit expiration times using either the Expires
   header, or the max-age directive of the Cache-Control header.
</t>
<t>
   An expiration time cannot be used to force a user agent to refresh
   its display or reload a resource; its semantics apply only to caching
   mechanisms, and such mechanisms need only check a resource's
   expiration status when a new request for that resource is initiated.
   See <xref target="history.lists"/> for an explanation of the difference between caches
   and history mechanisms.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Heuristic Expiration" anchor="heuristic.expiration">
<t>
   Since origin servers do not always provide explicit expiration times,
   HTTP caches typically assign heuristic expiration times, employing
   algorithms that use other header values (such as the Last-Modified
   time) to estimate a plausible expiration time. The HTTP/1.1
   specification does not provide specific algorithms, but does impose
   worst-case constraints on their results. Since heuristic expiration
   times might compromise semantic transparency, they ought to used
   cautiously, and we encourage origin servers to provide explicit
   expiration times as much as possible.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Age Calculations" anchor="age.calculations">
<t>
   In order to know if a cached entry is fresh, a cache needs to know if
   its age exceeds its freshness lifetime. We discuss how to calculate
   the latter in <xref target="expiration.calculations"/>; this section describes how to calculate
   the age of a response or cache entry.
</t>
<t>
   In this discussion, we use the term "now" to mean "the current value
   of the clock at the host performing the calculation." Hosts that use
   HTTP, but especially hosts running origin servers and caches, &SHOULD;
   use NTP <xref target="RFC1305"/> or some similar protocol to synchronize their clocks to
   a globally accurate time standard.
</t>
<t>
   HTTP/1.1 requires origin servers to send a Date header, if possible,
   with every response, giving the time at which the response was
   generated (see <xref target="header.date"/>). We use the term "date_value" to denote
   the value of the Date header, in a form appropriate for arithmetic
   operations.
</t>
<t>
   HTTP/1.1 uses the Age response-header to convey the estimated age of
   the response message when obtained from a cache. The Age field value
   is the cache's estimate of the amount of time since the response was
   generated or revalidated by the origin server.
</t>
<t>
   In essence, the Age value is the sum of the time that the response
   has been resident in each of the caches along the path from the
   origin server, plus the amount of time it has been in transit along
   network paths.
</t>
<t>
   We use the term "age_value" to denote the value of the Age header, in
   a form appropriate for arithmetic operations.
</t>
<t>
   A response's age can be calculated in two entirely independent ways:
  <list style="numbers">
      <t>now minus date_value, if the local clock is reasonably well
         synchronized to the origin server's clock. If the result is
         negative, the result is replaced by zero.</t>

      <t>age_value, if all of the caches along the response path
         implement HTTP/1.1.</t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   Given that we have two independent ways to compute the age of a
   response when it is received, we can combine these as
</t>
<figure><artwork type="code">
    corrected_received_age = max(now - date_value, age_value)
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   and as long as we have either nearly synchronized clocks or all-HTTP/1.1
   paths, one gets a reliable (conservative) result.
</t>
<t>
   Because of network-imposed delays, some significant interval might
   pass between the time that a server generates a response and the time
   it is received at the next outbound cache or client. If uncorrected,
   this delay could result in improperly low ages.
</t>
<t>
   Because the request that resulted in the returned Age value must have
   been initiated prior to that Age value's generation, we can correct
   for delays imposed by the network by recording the time at which the
   request was initiated. Then, when an Age value is received, it &MUST;
   be interpreted relative to the time the request was initiated, not
   the time that the response was received. This algorithm results in
   conservative behavior no matter how much delay is experienced. So, we
   compute:
</t>
<figure><artwork type="code">
   corrected_initial_age = corrected_received_age
                         + (now - request_time)
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   where "request_time" is the time (according to the local clock) when
   the request that elicited this response was sent.
</t>

<t>
   The current_age of a cache entry is calculated by adding the amount
   of time (in seconds) since the cache entry was last validated by the
   origin server to the corrected_initial_age. When a response is
   generated from a cache entry, the cache &MUST; include a single Age
   header field in the response with a value equal to the cache entry's
   current_age.
</t>
<t>
   The presence of an Age header field in a response implies that a
   response is not first-hand. However, the converse is not true, since
   the lack of an Age header field in a response does not imply that the
   response is first-hand unless all caches along the request path are
   compliant with HTTP/1.1 (i.e., older HTTP caches did not implement
   the Age header field).
</t>

<section title="Expiration Calculations" anchor="expiration.calculations">
<t>
   In order to decide whether a response is fresh or stale, we need to
   compare its freshness lifetime to its age. The age is calculated as
   described in <xref target="age.calculations"/>; this section describes how to calculate
   the freshness lifetime, and to determine if a response has expired.
   In the discussion below, the values can be represented in any form
   appropriate for arithmetic operations.
</t>
<t>
   We use the term "expires_value" to denote the value of the Expires
   header. We use the term "max_age_value" to denote an appropriate
   value of the number of seconds carried by the "max-age" directive of
   the Cache-Control header in a response (see <xref target="modifications.of.the.basic.expiration.mechanism"/>).
</t>
<t>
   The max-age directive takes priority over Expires, so if max-age is
   present in a response, the calculation is simply:
</t>
<figure><artwork type="code">
   freshness_lifetime = max_age_value
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   Otherwise, if Expires is present in the response, the calculation is:
</t>
<figure><artwork type="code">
   freshness_lifetime = expires_value - date_value
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   Note that neither of these calculations is vulnerable to clock skew,
   since all of the information comes from the origin server.
</t>
<t>
   If none of Expires, Cache-Control: max-age, or Cache-Control: s-maxage
   (see <xref target="modifications.of.the.basic.expiration.mechanism"/>) appears in the response, and the response
   does not include other restrictions on caching, the cache &MAY; compute
   a freshness lifetime using a heuristic. The cache &MUST; attach Warning
   113 to any response whose age is more than 24 hours if such warning
   has not already been added.
</t>
<t>
   Also, if the response does have a Last-Modified time, the heuristic
   expiration value &SHOULD; be no more than some fraction of the interval
   since that time. A typical setting of this fraction might be 10%.
</t>
<t>
   The calculation to determine if a response has expired is quite
   simple:
</t>
<figure><artwork type="code">
   response_is_fresh = (freshness_lifetime &gt; current_age)
</artwork></figure>
</section>

<section title="Disambiguating Expiration Values" anchor="disambiguating.expiration.values">
<t>
   Because expiration values are assigned optimistically, it is possible
   for two caches to contain fresh values for the same resource that are
   different.
</t>
<t>
   If a client performing a retrieval receives a non-first-hand response
   for a request that was already fresh in its own cache, and the Date
   header in its existing cache entry is newer than the Date on the new
   response, then the client &MAY; ignore the response. If so, it &MAY;
   retry the request with a "Cache-Control: max-age=0" directive (see
   <xref target="header.cache-control"/>), to force a check with the origin server.
</t>
<t>
   If a cache has two fresh responses for the same representation with
   different validators, it &MUST; use the one with the more recent Date
   header. This situation might arise because the cache is pooling
   responses from other caches, or because a client has asked for a
   reload or a revalidation of an apparently fresh cache entry.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Disambiguating Multiple Responses" anchor="disambiguating.multiple.responses">
<t>
   Because a client might be receiving responses via multiple paths, so
   that some responses flow through one set of caches and other
   responses flow through a different set of caches, a client might
   receive responses in an order different from that in which the origin
   server sent them. We would like the client to use the most recently
   generated response, even if older responses are still apparently
   fresh.
</t>
<t>
   Neither the entity tag nor the expiration value can impose an
   ordering on responses, since it is possible that a later response
   intentionally carries an earlier expiration time. The Date values are
   ordered to a granularity of one second.
</t>
<t>
   When a client tries to revalidate a cache entry, and the response it
   receives contains a Date header that appears to be older than the one
   for the existing entry, then the client &SHOULD; repeat the request
   unconditionally, and include
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
    Cache-Control: max-age=0
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   to force any intermediate caches to validate their copies directly
   with the origin server, or
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
    Cache-Control: no-cache
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   to force any intermediate caches to obtain a new copy from the origin
   server.
</t>
<t>
   If the Date values are equal, then the client &MAY; use either response
   (or &MAY;, if it is being extremely prudent, request a new response).
   Servers &MUST-NOT; depend on clients being able to choose
   deterministically between responses generated during the same second,
   if their expiration times overlap.
</t>
</section>
</section>

<section title="Validation Model" anchor="validation.model">
<t>
   When a cache has a stale entry that it would like to use as a
   response to a client's request, it first has to check with the origin
   server (or possibly an intermediate cache with a fresh response) to
   see if its cached entry is still usable. We call this "validating"
   the cache entry. Since we do not want to have to pay the overhead of
   retransmitting the full response if the cached entry is good, and we
   do not want to pay the overhead of an extra round trip if the cached
   entry is invalid, the HTTP/1.1 protocol supports the use of
   conditional methods.
</t>
<t>
   The key protocol features for supporting conditional methods are
   those concerned with "cache validators." When an origin server
   generates a full response, it attaches some sort of validator to it,
   which is kept with the cache entry. When a client (user agent or
   proxy cache) makes a conditional request for a resource for which it
   has a cache entry, it includes the associated validator in the
   request.
</t>
<t>
   The server then checks that validator against the current validator
   for the entity, and, if they match (see <xref target="weak.and.strong.validators"/>), it responds
   with a special status code (usually, <x:ref>304 (Not Modified)</x:ref>) and no
   entity-body. Otherwise, it returns a full response (including
   entity-body). Thus, we avoid transmitting the full response if the
   validator matches, and we avoid an extra round trip if it does not
   match.
</t>
<t>
   In HTTP/1.1, a conditional request looks exactly the same as a normal
   request for the same resource, except that it carries a special
   header (which includes the validator) that implicitly turns the
   method (usually, GET) into a conditional.
</t>
<t>
   The protocol includes both positive and negative senses of cache-validating
   conditions. That is, it is possible to request either that
   a method be performed if and only if a validator matches or if and
   only if no validators match.
  <list><t>
      <x:h>Note:</x:h> a response that lacks a validator may still be cached, and
      served from cache until it expires, unless this is explicitly
      prohibited by a cache-control directive. However, a cache cannot
      do a conditional retrieval if it does not have a validator for the
      entity, which means it will not be refreshable after it expires.
  </t></list>
</t>

<section title="Last-Modified Dates" anchor="last-modified.dates">
<t>
   The Last-Modified entity-header field value is often used as a cache
   validator. In simple terms, a cache entry is considered to be valid
   if the entity has not been modified since the Last-Modified value.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Entity Tag Cache Validators" anchor="entity.tag.cache.validators">
<t>
   The ETag response-header field value, an entity tag, provides for an
   "opaque" cache validator. This might allow more reliable validation
   in situations where it is inconvenient to store modification dates,
   where the one-second resolution of HTTP date values is not
   sufficient, or where the origin server wishes to avoid certain
   paradoxes that might arise from the use of modification dates.
</t>
<t>
   Entity Tags are described in <xref target="entity.tags"/>. The headers used with
   entity tags are described in sections <xref target="header.etag" format="counter"/>,
   <xref target="header.if-match" format="counter"/>, <xref target="header.if-none-match" format="counter"/>
   and <xref target="header.vary" format="counter"/>.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Weak and Strong Validators" anchor="weak.and.strong.validators">
<t>
   Since both origin servers and caches will compare two validators to
   decide if they represent the same or different entities, one normally
   would expect that if the entity (the entity-body or any entity-headers)
   changes in any way, then the associated validator would
   change as well. If this is true, then we call this validator a
   "strong validator."
</t>
<t>
   However, there might be cases when a server prefers to change the
   validator only on semantically significant changes, and not when
   insignificant aspects of the entity change. A validator that does not
   always change when the resource changes is a "weak validator."
</t>
<t>
   Entity tags are normally "strong validators," but the protocol
   provides a mechanism to tag an entity tag as "weak." One can think of
   a strong validator as one that changes whenever the bits of an entity
   changes, while a weak value changes whenever the meaning of an entity
   changes. Alternatively, one can think of a strong validator as part
   of an identifier for a specific entity, while a weak validator is
   part of an identifier for a set of semantically equivalent entities.
  <list><t>
      <x:h>Note:</x:h> One example of a strong validator is an integer that is
      incremented in stable storage every time an entity is changed.
    </t><t>
      An entity's modification time, if represented with one-second
      resolution, could be a weak validator, since it is possible that
      the resource might be modified twice during a single second.
    </t><t>
      Support for weak validators is optional. However, weak validators
      allow for more efficient caching of equivalent objects; for
      example, a hit counter on a site is probably good enough if it is
      updated every few days or weeks, and any value during that period
      is likely "good enough" to be equivalent.
    </t></list>
</t>
<t>
   A "use" of a validator is either when a client generates a request
   and includes the validator in a validating header field, or when a
   server compares two validators.
</t>
<t>
   Strong validators are usable in any context. Weak validators are only
   usable in contexts that do not depend on exact equality of an entity.
   For example, either kind is usable for a conditional GET of a full
   entity. However, only a strong validator is usable for a sub-range
   retrieval, since otherwise the client might end up with an internally
   inconsistent entity.
</t>
<t>
   Clients &MAY; issue simple (non-subrange) GET requests with either weak
   validators or strong validators. Clients &MUST-NOT; use weak validators
   in other forms of request.
</t>
<t>
   The only function that the HTTP/1.1 protocol defines on validators is
   comparison. There are two validator comparison functions, depending
   on whether the comparison context allows the use of weak validators
   or not:
  <list style="symbols">
     <t>The strong comparison function: in order to be considered equal,
        both validators &MUST; be identical in every way, and both &MUST-NOT;
        be weak.</t>
     <t>The weak comparison function: in order to be considered equal,
        both validators &MUST; be identical in every way, but either or
        both of them &MAY; be tagged as "weak" without affecting the
        result.</t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   An entity tag is strong unless it is explicitly tagged as weak.
   <xref target="entity.tags"/> gives the syntax for entity tags.
</t>
<t>
   A Last-Modified time, when used as a validator in a request, is
   implicitly weak unless it is possible to deduce that it is strong,
   using the following rules:
  <list style="symbols">
     <t>The validator is being compared by an origin server to the
        actual current validator for the entity and,</t>
     <t>That origin server reliably knows that the associated entity did
        not change twice during the second covered by the presented
        validator.</t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   or
  <list style="symbols">
     <t>The validator is about to be used by a client in an If-Modified-Since
        or If-Unmodified-Since header, because the client
        has a cache entry for the associated entity, and</t>
     <t>That cache entry includes a Date value, which gives the time
        when the origin server sent the original response, and</t>
     <t>The presented Last-Modified time is at least 60 seconds before
        the Date value.</t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   or
  <list style="symbols">
     <t>The validator is being compared by an intermediate cache to the
        validator stored in its cache entry for the entity, and</t>
     <t>That cache entry includes a Date value, which gives the time
        when the origin server sent the original response, and</t>
     <t>The presented Last-Modified time is at least 60 seconds before
        the Date value.</t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   This method relies on the fact that if two different responses were
   sent by the origin server during the same second, but both had the
   same Last-Modified time, then at least one of those responses would
   have a Date value equal to its Last-Modified time. The arbitrary 60-second
   limit guards against the possibility that the Date and Last-Modified
   values are generated from different clocks, or at somewhat
   different times during the preparation of the response. An
   implementation &MAY; use a value larger than 60 seconds, if it is
   believed that 60 seconds is too short.
</t>
<t>
   If a client wishes to perform a sub-range retrieval on a value for
   which it has only a Last-Modified time and no opaque validator, it
   &MAY; do this only if the Last-Modified time is strong in the sense
   described here.
</t>
<t>
   A cache or origin server receiving a conditional request, other than
   a full-body GET request, &MUST; use the strong comparison function to
   evaluate the condition.
</t>
<t>
   These rules allow HTTP/1.1 caches and clients to safely perform sub-range
   retrievals on values that have been obtained from HTTP/1.0
   servers.

<section title="Rules for When to Use Entity Tags and Last-Modified Dates" anchor="rules.for.when.to.use.entity.tags.and.last-modified.dates">
<t>
   We adopt a set of rules and recommendations for origin servers,
   clients, and caches regarding when various validator types ought to
   be used, and for what purposes.
</t>
<t>
   HTTP/1.1 origin servers:
  <list style="symbols">
     <t>&SHOULD; send an entity tag validator unless it is not feasible to
        generate one.</t>

     <t>&MAY; send a weak entity tag instead of a strong entity tag, if
        performance considerations support the use of weak entity tags,
        or if it is unfeasible to send a strong entity tag.</t>

     <t>&SHOULD; send a Last-Modified value if it is feasible to send one,
        unless the risk of a breakdown in semantic transparency that
        could result from using this date in an If-Modified-Since header
        would lead to serious problems.</t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   In other words, the preferred behavior for an HTTP/1.1 origin server
   is to send both a strong entity tag and a Last-Modified value.
</t>
<t>
   In order to be legal, a strong entity tag &MUST; change whenever the
   associated entity value changes in any way. A weak entity tag &SHOULD;
   change whenever the associated entity changes in a semantically
   significant way.
  <list><t>
      <x:h>Note:</x:h> in order to provide semantically transparent caching, an
      origin server must avoid reusing a specific strong entity tag
      value for two different entities, or reusing a specific weak
      entity tag value for two semantically different entities. Cache
      entries might persist for arbitrarily long periods, regardless of
      expiration times, so it might be inappropriate to expect that a
      cache will never again attempt to validate an entry using a
      validator that it obtained at some point in the past.
  </t></list>
</t>
<t>
   HTTP/1.1 clients:
  <list style="symbols">
     <t>If an entity tag has been provided by the origin server, &MUST;
        use that entity tag in any cache-conditional request (using If-Match

<t>
   An HTTP/1.1 origin server, upon receiving a conditional request that

   If-Unmodified-Since header field) and one or more entity tags (e.g.,
   in an If-Match, If-None-Match, or If-Range header field) as cache

      conservative assumptions about the validators they receive.
  </t><t>
      HTTP/1.0 clients and caches will ignore entity tags. Generally,
      last-modified values received or used by these systems will
      support transparent and efficient caching, and so HTTP/1.1 origin
      servers should provide Last-Modified values. In those rare cases
      where the use of a Last-Modified value as a validator by an

<section title="Non-validating Conditionals" anchor="non-validating.conditionals">
<t>
   The principle behind entity tags is that only the service author
   knows the semantics of a resource well enough to select an
   appropriate cache validation mechanism, and the specification of any
   validator comparison function more complex than byte-equality would
   open up a can of worms. Thus, comparisons of any other headers
   (except Last-Modified, for compatibility with HTTP/1.0) are never
   used for purposes of validating a cache entry.

<section title="Response Cacheability" anchor="response.cacheability">
<t>
   Unless specifically constrained by a cache-control (<xref target="header.cache-control"/>)

   if it is fresh, and &MAY; return it after successful validation. If
   there is neither a cache validator nor an explicit expiration time
   associated with a response, we do not expect it to be cached, but
   certain caches &MAY; violate this expectation (for example, when little
   or no network connectivity is available). A client can usually detect

   However, in some cases it might be inappropriate for a cache to
   retain an entity, or to return it in response to a subsequent
   request. This might be because absolute semantic transparency is
   deemed necessary by the service author, or because of security or
   privacy considerations. Certain cache-control directives are

<section title="Combining Headers" anchor="combining.headers">
<t>
   When a cache makes a validating request to a server, and the server
   provides a <x:ref>304 (Not Modified)</x:ref> response or a <x:ref>206 (Partial Content)</x:ref>
   response, the cache then constructs a response to send to the
   requesting client.
</t>
<t>
   If the status code is <x:ref>304 (Not Modified)</x:ref>, the cache uses the entity-body
   stored in the cache entry as the entity-body of this outgoing
   response. If the status code is <x:ref>206 (Partial Content)</x:ref> and the ETag or
   Last-Modified headers match exactly, the cache &MAY; combine the
   contents stored in the cache entry with the new contents received in
   the response and use the result as the entity-body of this outgoing
   response, (see <xref target="combining.byte.ranges" format="counter"/>).
</t>
<t>
   The end-to-end headers stored in the cache entry are used for the
   constructed response, except that
  <list style="symbols">
    <t>any stored Warning headers with warn-code 1xx (see <xref target="header.warning"/>)
      &MUST; be deleted from the cache entry and the forwarded response.</t>
    <t>any stored Warning headers with warn-code 2xx &MUST; be retained
        in the cache entry and the forwarded response.</t>
    <t>any end-to-end headers provided in the 304 or 206 response &MUST;
        replace the corresponding headers from the cache entry.</t>
  </list>
</t>

   Unless the cache decides to remove the cache entry, it &MUST; also
   replace the end-to-end headers stored with the cache entry with
   corresponding headers received in the incoming response, except for
   Warning headers as described immediately above. If a header field-name
   in the incoming response matches more than one header in the
   cache entry, all such old headers &MUST; be replaced.
</t>
<t>
   In other words, the set of end-to-end headers received in the
   incoming response overrides all corresponding end-to-end headers
   stored with the cache entry (except for stored Warning headers with
   warn-code 1xx, which are deleted even if not overridden).

<t>
   A response might transfer only a subrange of the bytes of an entity-body,
   either because the request included one or more Range
   specifications, or because a connection was broken prematurely. After
   several such transfers, a cache might have received several ranges of
   the same entity-body.
</t>
<t>
   If a cache has a stored non-empty set of subranges for an entity, and
   an incoming response transfers another subrange, the cache &MAY;

<section title="Caching Negotiated Responses" anchor="caching.negotiated.responses">
<t>
   Use of server-driven content negotiation (<xref target="server-driven.negotiation"/>), as indicated

   conditions and procedure by which a cache can use the response for
   subsequent requests. See <xref target="header.vary"/> for use of the Vary header
   field by servers.
</t>
<t>
   A server &SHOULD; use the Vary header field to inform a cache of what
   request-header fields were used to select among multiple
   representations of a cacheable response subject to server-driven
   negotiation. The set of header fields named by the Vary field value
   is known as the "selecting" request-headers.
</t>
<t>
   When the cache receives a subsequent request whose Request-URI
   specifies one or more cache entries including a Vary header field,
   the cache &MUST-NOT; use such a cache entry to construct a response to
   the new request unless all of the selecting request-headers present
   in the new request match the corresponding stored request-headers in
   the original request.
</t>
<t>
   The selecting request-headers from two requests are defined to match
   if and only if the selecting request-headers in the first request can
   be transformed to the selecting request-headers in the second request
   by adding or removing linear white space (LWS) at places where this
   is allowed by the corresponding BNF, and/or combining multiple
   message-header fields with the same field name following the rules
   about message headers in <xref target="message.headers"/>.
</t>
<t>
   A Vary header field-value of "*" always fails to match and subsequent
   requests on that resource can only be properly interpreted by the
   origin server.
</t>
<t>
   If the selecting request header fields for the cached entry do not
   match the selecting request header fields of the new request, then
   the cache &MUST-NOT; use a cached entry to satisfy the request unless
   it first relays the new request to the origin server in a conditional
   request and the server responds with <x:ref>304 (Not Modified)</x:ref>, including an
   entity tag or Content-Location that indicates the entity to be used.
</t>
<t>
   If an entity tag was assigned to a cached representation, the
   forwarded request &SHOULD; be conditional and include the entity tags
   in an If-None-Match header field from all its cache entries for the
   resource. This conveys to the server the set of entities currently
   held by the cache, so that if any one of these entities matches the
   requested entity, the server can use the ETag header field in its 304
   (Not Modified) response to tell the cache which entry is appropriate.
   If the entity-tag of the new response matches that of an existing
   entry, the new response &SHOULD; be used to update the header fields of
   the existing entry, and the result &MUST; be returned to the client.
</t>
<t>
   If any of the existing cache entries contains only partial content
   for the associated entity, its entity-tag &SHOULD-NOT;  be included in
   the If-None-Match header field unless the request is for a range that
   would be fully satisfied by that entry.
</t>
<t>
   If a cache receives a successful response whose Content-Location
   field matches that of an existing cache entry for the same Request-URI,
   whose entity-tag differs from that of the existing entry, and
   whose Date is more recent than that of the existing entry, the
   existing entry &SHOULD-NOT;  be returned in response to future requests

<section title="Shared and Non-Shared Caches" anchor="shared.and.non-shared.caches">

   For reasons of security and privacy, it is necessary to make a
   distinction between "shared" and "non-shared" caches. A non-shared
   cache is one that is accessible only to a single user. Accessibility
   in this case &SHOULD; be enforced by appropriate security mechanisms.
   All other caches are considered to be "shared." Other sections of

<section title="Errors or Incomplete Response Cache Behavior" anchor="errors.or.incomplete.response.cache.behavior">
<t>
   A cache that receives an incomplete response (for example, with fewer

   the response. However, the cache &MUST; treat this as a partial
   response. Partial responses &MAY; be combined as described in <xref target="combining.byte.ranges"/>;
   the result might be a full response or might still be
   partial. A cache &MUST-NOT; return a partial response to a client
   without explicitly marking it as such, using the <x:ref>206 (Partial Content)</x:ref>
   status code. A cache &MUST-NOT; return a partial response
   using a status code of <x:ref>200 (OK)</x:ref>.
</t>
<t>
   If a cache receives a 5xx response while attempting to revalidate an
   entry, it &MAY; either forward this response to the requesting client,
   or act as if the server failed to respond. In the latter case, it &MAY;
   return a previously received response unless the cached entry
   includes the "must-revalidate" cache-control directive (see <xref target="header.cache-control"/>).
</t>

<section title="Side Effects of GET and HEAD" anchor="side.effects.of.get.and.head">
<t>
   Unless the origin server explicitly prohibits the caching of their
   responses, the application of GET and HEAD methods to any resources
   &SHOULD-NOT;  have side effects that would lead to erroneous behavior if
   these responses are taken from a cache. They &MAY; still have side
   effects, but a cache is not required to consider such side effects in
   its caching decisions. Caches are always expected to observe an
   origin server's explicit restrictions on caching.
</t>
<t>
   We note one exception to this rule: since some applications have
   traditionally used GETs and HEADs with query URLs (those containing a
   "?" in the rel_path part) to perform operations with significant side
   effects, caches &MUST-NOT; treat responses to such URIs as fresh unless
   the server provides an explicit expiration time. This specifically
   means that responses from HTTP/1.0 servers for such URIs &SHOULD-NOT; 
   be taken from a cache. See <xref target="safe.methods"/> for related information.

</section>

<section title="Invalidation After Updates or Deletions" anchor="invalidation.after.updates.or.deletions">
<t>
   The effect of certain methods performed on a resource at the origin
   server might cause one or more existing cache entries to become non-transparently
   invalid. That is, although they might continue to be
   "fresh," they do not accurately reflect what the origin server would
   return for a new request on that resource.
</t>
<t>
   There is no way for the HTTP protocol to guarantee that all such
   cache entries are marked invalid. For example, the request that
   caused the change at the origin server might not have gone through
   the proxy where a cache entry is stored. However, several rules help
   reduce the likelihood of erroneous behavior.
</t>
<t>
   In this section, the phrase "invalidate an entity" means that the
   cache will either remove all instances of that entity from its
   storage, or will mark these as "invalid" and in need of a mandatory
   revalidation before they can be returned in response to a subsequent
   request.
</t>
<t>
   Some HTTP methods &MUST; cause a cache to invalidate an entity. This is
   either the entity referred to by the Request-URI, or by the Location
   or Content-Location headers (if present). These methods are:
  <list style="symbols">
      <t>PUT</t>
      <t>DELETE</t>
      <t>POST</t>
  </list>
</t>  
<t>
   In order to prevent denial of service attacks, an invalidation based
   on the URI in a Location or Content-Location header &MUST; only be
   performed if the host part is the same as in the Request-URI.
</t>
<t>
   A cache that passes through requests for methods it does not
   understand &SHOULD; invalidate any entities referred to by the
   Request-URI.

<section title="Write-Through Mandatory" anchor="write-through.mandatory">
<t>
   All methods that might be expected to cause modifications to the

   server. This currently includes all methods except for GET and HEAD.
   A cache &MUST-NOT; reply to such a request from a client before having
   transmitted the request to the inbound server, and having received a
   corresponding response from the inbound server. This does not prevent
   a proxy cache from sending a <x:ref>100 (Continue)</x:ref> response before the
   inbound server has sent its final reply.
</t>
<t>
   The alternative (known as "write-back" or "copy-back" caching) is not

   User agents often have history mechanisms, such as "Back" buttons and

</t>
<t>
   History mechanisms and caches are different. In particular history
   mechanisms &SHOULD-NOT;  try to show a semantically transparent view of
   the current state of a resource. Rather, a history mechanism is meant
   to show exactly what the user saw at the time when the resource was
   retrieved.
</t>
<t>
   By default, an expiration time does not apply to history mechanisms.
   If the entity is still in storage, a history mechanism &SHOULD; display
   it even if the entity has expired, unless the user has specifically
   configured the agent to refresh expired history documents.

   This is not to be construed to prohibit the history mechanism from
   telling the user that a view might be stale.

      resources ought not to cached, or ought to expire quickly, user
      interface considerations may force service authors to resort to

<section title="Header Field Definitions" anchor="header.fields">
<t>
   This section defines the syntax and semantics of all standard

   sends and who receives the entity.
</t>

<section title="Accept" anchor="header.accept">
  <iref primary="true" item="Accept header" x:for-anchor=""/>
  <iref primary="true" item="Headers" subitem="Accept" x:for-anchor=""/>
<t>
   The Accept request-header field can be used to specify certain media
   types which are acceptable for the response. Accept headers can be
   used to indicate that the request is specifically limited to a small
   set of desired types, as in the case of a request for an in-line
   image.
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="Accept"/><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="media-range"/><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="accept-params"/><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="accept-extension"/>
    Accept         = "Accept" ":"

</artwork></figure>
<t>
   The asterisk "*" character is used to group media types into ranges,
   with "*/*" indicating all media types and "type/*" indicating all
   subtypes of that type. The media-range &MAY; include media type
   parameters that are applicable to that range.
</t>
<t>
   Each media-range &MAY; be followed by one or more accept-params,
   beginning with the "q" parameter for indicating a relative quality
   factor. The first "q" parameter (if any) separates the media-range
   parameter(s) from the accept-params. Quality factors allow the user
   or user agent to indicate the relative degree of preference for that
   media-range, using the qvalue scale from 0 to 1 (<xref target="quality.values"/>). The
   default value is q=1.
  <list><t>
      <x:h>Note:</x:h> Use of the "q" parameter name to separate media type
      parameters from Accept extension parameters is due to historical
      practice. Although this prevents any media type parameter named
      "q" from being used with a media range, such an event is believed
      to be unlikely given the lack of any "q" parameters in the IANA
      media type registry and the rare usage of any media type
      parameters in Accept. Future media types are discouraged from
      registering any parameter named "q".
  </t></list>
</t>
<t>
   The example
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
    Accept: audio/*; q=0.2, audio/basic
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   &SHOULD; be interpreted as "I prefer audio/basic, but send me any audio
   type if it is the best available after an 80% mark-down in quality."
</t>
<t>
   If no Accept header field is present, then it is assumed that the
   client accepts all media types. If an Accept header field is present,
   and if the server cannot send a response which is acceptable
   according to the combined Accept field value, then the server &SHOULD;
   send a <x:ref>406 (not acceptable)</x:ref> response.
</t>
<t>
   A more elaborate example is
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
    Accept: text/plain; q=0.5, text/html,
            text/x-dvi; q=0.8, text/x-c
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   Verbally, this would be interpreted as "text/html and text/x-c are
   the preferred media types, but if they do not exist, then send the
   text/x-dvi entity, and if that does not exist, send the text/plain
   entity."
</t>
<t>
   Media ranges can be overridden by more specific media ranges or
   specific media types. If more than one media range applies to a given
   type, the most specific reference has precedence. For example,
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
    Accept: text/*, text/html, text/html;level=1, */*
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   have the following precedence:
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
    1) text/html;level=1
    2) text/html
    3) text/*
    4) */*
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   The media type quality factor associated with a given type is
   determined by finding the media range with the highest precedence
   which matches that type. For example,
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
    Accept: text/*;q=0.3, text/html;q=0.7, text/html;level=1,
            text/html;level=2;q=0.4, */*;q=0.5
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   would cause the following values to be associated:
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
    text/html;level=1         = 1
    text/html                 = 0.7
    text/plain                = 0.3
    image/jpeg                = 0.5
    text/html;level=2         = 0.4
    text/html;level=3         = 0.7
</artwork></figure>
<t>
      <x:h>Note:</x:h> A user agent might be provided with a default set of quality
      values for certain media ranges. However, unless the user agent is
      a closed system which cannot interact with other rendering agents,
      this default set ought to be configurable by the user.

  <iref primary="true" item="Headers" subitem="Accept-Charset" x:for-anchor=""/>
<t>
   The Accept-Charset request-header field can be used to indicate what
   character sets are acceptable for the response. This field allows
   clients capable of understanding more comprehensive or special-purpose
   character sets to signal that capability to a server which is
   capable of representing documents in those character sets.

   Character set values are described in <xref target="character.sets"/>. Each charset &MAY;

</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
   Accept-Charset: iso-8859-5, unicode-1-1;q=0.8
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   The special value "*", if present in the Accept-Charset field,
   matches every character set (including ISO-8859-1) which is not
   mentioned elsewhere in the Accept-Charset field. If no "*" is present
   in an Accept-Charset field, then all character sets not explicitly
   mentioned get a quality value of 0, except for ISO-8859-1, which gets
   a quality value of 1 if not explicitly mentioned.
</t>
<t>
   If no Accept-Charset header is present, the default is that any
   character set is acceptable. If an Accept-Charset header is present,
   and if the server cannot send a response which is acceptable
   according to the Accept-Charset header, then the server &SHOULD; send

   A server tests whether a content-coding is acceptable, according to
   an Accept-Encoding field, using these rules:
  <list style="numbers">
      <t>If the content-coding is one of the content-codings listed in
         the Accept-Encoding field, then it is acceptable, unless it is
         accompanied by a qvalue of 0. (As defined in <xref target="quality.values"/>, a
         qvalue of 0 means "not acceptable.")</t>

      <t>The special "*" symbol in an Accept-Encoding field matches any
         available content-coding not explicitly listed in the header
         field.</t>

      <t>If multiple content-codings are acceptable, then the acceptable
         content-coding with the highest non-zero qvalue is preferred.</t>

      <t>The "identity" content-coding is always acceptable, unless
         specifically refused because the Accept-Encoding field includes
         "identity;q=0", or because the field includes "*;q=0" and does
         not explicitly include the "identity" content-coding. If the
         Accept-Encoding field-value is empty, then only the "identity"
         encoding is acceptable.</t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   If an Accept-Encoding field is present in a request, and if the
   server cannot send a response which is acceptable according to the
   Accept-Encoding header, then the server &SHOULD; send an error response
   with the <x:ref>406 (Not Acceptable)</x:ref> status code.
</t>
<t>
   If no Accept-Encoding field is present in a request, the server &MAY;
   assume that the client will accept any content coding. In this case,
   if "identity" is one of the available content-codings, then the
   server &SHOULD; use the "identity" content-coding, unless it has
   additional information that a different content-coding is meaningful
   to the client.
  <list><t>
      <x:h>Note:</x:h> If the request does not include an Accept-Encoding field,
      and if the "identity" content-coding is unavailable, then
      content-codings commonly understood by HTTP/1.0 clients (i.e.,
      "gzip" and "compress") are preferred; some older clients
      improperly display messages sent with other content-codings.  The
      server might also make this decision based on information about
      the particular user-agent or client.

   The Accept-Language request-header field is similar to Accept, but
   restricts the set of natural languages that are preferred as a

</artwork></figure>
<t>
   Each language-range &MAY; be given an associated quality value which
   represents an estimate of the user's preference for the languages
   specified by that range. The quality value defaults to "q=1". For
   example,
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
    Accept-Language: da, en-gb;q=0.8, en;q=0.7
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   would mean: "I prefer Danish, but will accept British English and
   other types of English." A language-range matches a language-tag if
   it exactly equals the tag, or if it exactly equals a prefix of the
   tag such that the first tag character following the prefix is "-".
   The special range "*", if present in the Accept-Language field,
   matches every tag not matched by any other range present in the
   Accept-Language field.
  <list><t>
      <x:h>Note:</x:h> This use of a prefix matching rule does not imply that
      language tags are assigned to languages in such a way that it is
      always true that if a user understands a language with a certain
      tag, then this user will also understand all languages with tags
      for which this tag is a prefix. The prefix rule simply allows the
      use of prefix tags if this is the case.
  </t></list>
</t>
<t>
   The language quality factor assigned to a language-tag by the
   Accept-Language field is the quality value of the longest language-range
   in the field that matches the language-tag. If no language-range
   in the field matches the tag, the language quality factor
   assigned is 0. If no Accept-Language header is present in the
   request, the server
   &SHOULD; assume that all languages are equally acceptable. If an
   Accept-Language header is present, then all languages which are
   assigned a quality factor greater than 0 are acceptable.
</t>
<t>
   It might be contrary to the privacy expectations of the user to send
   an Accept-Language header with the complete linguistic preferences of
   the user in every request. For a discussion of this issue, see
   <xref target="privacy.issues.connected.to.accept.headers"/>.
</t>
<t>
   As intelligibility is highly dependent on the individual user, it is
   recommended that client applications make the choice of linguistic
   preference available to the user. If the choice is not made
   available, then the Accept-Language header field &MUST-NOT; be given in
   the request.
  <list><t>
      <x:h>Note:</x:h> When making the choice of linguistic preference available to
      the user, we remind implementors of  the fact that users are not
      familiar with the details of language matching as described above,
      and should provide appropriate guidance. As an example, users
      might assume that on selecting "en-gb", they will be served any
      kind of English document if British English is not available. A
      user agent might suggest in such a case to add "en" to get the
      best matching behavior.

      The Age response-header field conveys the sender's estimate of the

      its age does not exceed its freshness lifetime. Age values are

      integer it can represent, or if any of its age calculations
      overflows, it &MUST; transmit an Age header with a value of
      2147483648 (2^31). An HTTP/1.1 server that includes a cache &MUST;

      The Allow entity-header field lists the set of methods supported
      by the resource identified by the Request-URI. The purpose of this

      This field cannot prevent a client from trying other methods.
      However, the indications given by the Allow header field value
      &SHOULD; be followed. The actual set of allowed methods is defined
      by the origin server at the time of each request.
</t>
<t>
      The Allow header field &MAY; be provided with a PUT request to
      recommend the methods to be supported by the new or modified
      resource. The server is not required to support these methods and
      &SHOULD; include an Allow header in the response giving the actual
      supported methods.
</t>
<t>

      A user agent that wishes to authenticate itself with a server--

  <list><t>   
      The purpose of the no-store directive is to prevent the
      inadvertent release or retention of sensitive information (for
      example, on backup tapes). The no-store directive applies to the
      entire message, and &MAY; be sent either in a response or in a
      request. If sent in a request, a cache &MUST-NOT; store any part of
      either this request or any response to it. If sent in a response,
      a cache &MUST-NOT; store any part of either this response or the
      request that elicited it. This directive applies to both non-shared
      and shared caches. "&MUST-NOT; store" in this context means
      that the cache &MUST-NOT; intentionally store the information in
      non-volatile storage, and &MUST; make a best-effort attempt to
      remove the information from volatile storage as promptly as
      possible after forwarding it.
  </t><t>
      Even when this directive is associated with a response, users
      might explicitly store such a response outside of the caching
      system (e.g., with a "Save As" dialog). History buffers &MAY; store
      such responses as part of their normal operation.
  </t><t>
      The purpose of this directive is to meet the stated requirements
      of certain users and service authors who are concerned about
      accidental releases of information via unanticipated accesses to
      cache data structures. While the use of this directive might
      improve privacy in some cases, we caution that it is NOT in any
      way a reliable or sufficient mechanism for ensuring privacy. In
      particular, malicious or compromised caches might not recognize or
      obey this directive, and communications networks might be
      vulnerable to eavesdropping.

<section title="Modifications of the Basic Expiration Mechanism" anchor="modifications.of.the.basic.expiration.mechanism">
<t>
   The expiration time of an entity &MAY; be specified by the origin
   server using the Expires header (see <xref target="header.expires"/>). Alternatively,
   it &MAY; be specified using the max-age directive in a response. When
   the max-age cache-control directive is present in a cached response,
   the response is stale if its current age is greater than the age
   value given (in seconds) at the time of a new request for that
   resource. The max-age directive on a response implies that the
   response is cacheable (i.e., "public") unless some other, more
   restrictive cache directive is also present.
</t>
<t>
   If a response includes both an Expires header and a max-age
   directive, the max-age directive overrides the Expires header, even
   if the Expires header is more restrictive. This rule allows an origin
   server to provide, for a given response, a longer expiration time to
   an HTTP/1.1 (or later) cache than to an HTTP/1.0 cache. This might be
   useful if certain HTTP/1.0 caches improperly calculate ages or
   expiration times, perhaps due to desynchronized clocks.
</t>
<t>
   Many HTTP/1.0 cache implementations will treat an Expires value that
   is less than or equal to the response Date value as being equivalent
   to the Cache-Control response directive "no-cache". If an HTTP/1.1
   cache receives such a response, and the response does not include a
   Cache-Control header field, it &SHOULD; consider the response to be
   non-cacheable in order to retain compatibility with HTTP/1.0 servers.
  <list><t>
       <x:h>Note:</x:h> An origin server might wish to use a relatively new HTTP
       cache control feature, such as the "private" directive, on a
       network including older caches that do not understand that
       feature. The origin server will need to combine the new feature
       with an Expires field whose value is less than or equal to the
       Date value. This will prevent older caches from improperly
       caching the response.
  </t></list>

<t>
  <iref item="Cache Directives" subitem="s-maxage" primary="true"/>
  <iref item="s-maxage" subitem="Cache Directive" primary="true"/>
   s-maxage
  <list><t>
       If a response includes an s-maxage directive, then for a shared
       cache (but not for a private cache), the maximum age specified by
       this directive overrides the maximum age specified by either the
       max-age directive or the Expires header. The s-maxage directive
       also implies the semantics of the proxy-revalidate directive (see
       <xref target="cache.revalidation.and.reload.controls"/>), i.e., that the shared cache must not use the
       entry after it becomes stale to respond to a subsequent request
       without first revalidating it with the origin server. The s-maxage
       directive is always ignored by a private cache.
  </t></list>
</t>
<t>
   Note that most older caches, not compliant with this specification,
   do not implement any cache-control directives. An origin server
   wishing to use a cache-control directive that restricts, but does not
   prevent, caching by an HTTP/1.1-compliant cache &MAY; exploit the
   requirement that the max-age directive overrides the Expires header,
   and the fact that pre-HTTP/1.1-compliant caches do not observe the
   max-age directive.
</t>
<t>
   Other directives allow a user agent to modify the basic expiration
   mechanism. These directives &MAY; be specified on a request:

  <iref item="max-age" subitem="Cache Directive" primary="true"/>
   max-age

      directive is also included, the client is not willing to
      accept a stale response.

  <list><t>
      Indicates that the client is willing to accept a response whose
      freshness lifetime is no less than its current age plus the
      specified time in seconds. That is, the client wants a response
      that will still be fresh for at least the specified number of
      seconds.

   max-stale
  <list><t>
      Indicates that the client is willing to accept a response that has

      then the client is willing to accept a response that has exceeded
      its expiration time by no more than the specified number of
      seconds. If no value is assigned to max-stale, then the client is
      willing to accept a stale response of any age.
  </t></list>
</t>
<t>
   If a cache returns a stale response, either because of a max-stale
   directive on a request, or because the cache is configured to
   override the expiration time of a response, the cache &MUST; attach a
   Warning header to the stale response, using Warning 110 (Response is
   stale).
</t>
<t>
   A cache &MAY; be configured to return stale responses without
   validation, but only if this does not conflict with any "MUST"-level
   requirements concerning cache validation (e.g., a "must-revalidate"
   cache-control directive).
</t>
<t>
   If both the new request and the cached entry include "max-age"
   directives, then the lesser of the two values is used for determining
   the freshness of the cached entry for that request.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Cache Revalidation and Reload Controls" anchor="cache.revalidation.and.reload.controls">
<t>
   Sometimes a user agent might want or need to insist that a cache
   revalidate its cache entry with the origin server (and not just with
   the next cache along the path to the origin server), or to reload its
   cache entry from the origin server. End-to-end revalidation might be
   necessary if either the cache or the origin server has overestimated
   the expiration time of the cached response. End-to-end reload may be
   necessary if the cache entry has become corrupted for some reason.
</t>
<t>
   End-to-end revalidation may be requested either when the client does
   not have its own local cached copy, in which case we call it
   "unspecified end-to-end revalidation", or when the client does have a
   local cached copy, in which case we call it "specific end-to-end
   revalidation."
</t>
<t>
   The client can specify these three kinds of action using Cache-Control
   request directives:
</t>
<t>
   End-to-end reload
  <list><t>
      The request includes a "no-cache" cache-control directive or, for
      compatibility with HTTP/1.0 clients, "Pragma: no-cache". Field
      names &MUST-NOT; be included with the no-cache directive in a
      request. The server &MUST-NOT; use a cached copy when responding to
      such a request.
  </t></list>
</t>
<t>
   Specific end-to-end revalidation
  <list><t>
      The request includes a "max-age=0" cache-control directive, which
      forces each cache along the path to the origin server to
      revalidate its own entry, if any, with the next cache or server.
      The initial request includes a cache-validating conditional with
      the client's current validator.
  </t></list>
</t>
<t>
   Unspecified end-to-end revalidation
  <list><t>
      The request includes "max-age=0" cache-control directive, which
      forces each cache along the path to the origin server to
      revalidate its own entry, if any, with the next cache or server.
      The initial request does not include a cache-validating
      conditional; the first cache along the path (if any) that holds a
      cache entry for this resource includes a cache-validating
      conditional with its current validator.
  </t></list>

<t>
  <iref item="Cache Directives" subitem="max-age" primary="true"/>
  <iref item="max-age" subitem="Cache Directive" primary="true"/>
   max-age
  <list><t>
      When an intermediate cache is forced, by means of a max-age=0
      directive, to revalidate its own cache entry, and the client has
      supplied its own validator in the request, the supplied validator
      might differ from the validator currently stored with the cache
      entry. In this case, the cache &MAY; use either validator in making
      its own request without affecting semantic transparency.
  </t><t>
      However, the choice of validator might affect performance. The
      best approach is for the intermediate cache to use its own
      validator when making its request. If the server replies with 304
      (Not Modified), then the cache can return its now validated copy
      to the client with a <x:ref>200 (OK)</x:ref> response. If the server replies with
      a new entity and cache validator, however, the intermediate cache
      can compare the returned validator with the one provided in the
      client's request, using the strong comparison function. If the
      client's validator is equal to the origin server's, then the
      intermediate cache simply returns <x:ref>304 (Not Modified)</x:ref>. Otherwise,
      it returns the new entity with a <x:ref>200 (OK)</x:ref> response.
  </t><t>
      If a request includes the no-cache directive, it &SHOULD-NOT; 
      include min-fresh, max-stale, or max-age.

  <list><t>
      In some cases, such as times of extremely poor network
      connectivity, a client may want a cache to return only those
      responses that it currently has stored, and not to reload or
      revalidate with the origin server. To do this, the client may
      include the only-if-cached directive in a request. If it receives
      this directive, a cache &SHOULD; either respond using a cached entry
      that is consistent with the other constraints of the request, or
      respond with a <x:ref>504 (Gateway Timeout)</x:ref> status. However, if a group
      of caches is being operated as a unified system with good internal
      connectivity, such a request &MAY; be forwarded within that group of
      caches.

  <iref item="must-revalidate" subitem="Cache Directive" primary="true"/>
   must-revalidate
  <list><t>
      Because a cache &MAY; be configured to ignore a server's specified
      expiration time, and because a client request &MAY; include a max-stale
      directive (which has a similar effect), the protocol also
      includes a mechanism for the origin server to require revalidation
      of a cache entry on any subsequent use. When the must-revalidate
      directive is present in a response received by a cache, that cache
      &MUST-NOT; use the entry after it becomes stale to respond to a
      subsequent request without first revalidating it with the origin
      server. (I.e., the cache &MUST; do an end-to-end revalidation every
      time, if, based solely on the origin server's Expires or max-age
      value, the cached response is stale.)
  </t><t>
      The must-revalidate directive is necessary to support reliable
      operation for certain protocol features. In all circumstances an
      HTTP/1.1 cache &MUST; obey the must-revalidate directive; in
      particular, if the cache cannot reach the origin server for any
      reason, it &MUST; generate a <x:ref>504 (Gateway Timeout)</x:ref> response.
  </t><t>
      Servers &SHOULD; send the must-revalidate directive if and only if
      failure to revalidate a request on the entity could result in
      incorrect operation, such as a silently unexecuted financial
      transaction. Recipients &MUST-NOT; take any automated action that
      violates this directive, and &MUST-NOT; automatically provide an
      unvalidated copy of the entity if revalidation fails.
  </t><t>
      Although this is not recommended, user agents operating under
      severe connectivity constraints &MAY; violate this directive but, if
      so, &MUST; explicitly warn the user that an unvalidated response has
      been provided. The warning &MUST; be provided on each unvalidated
      access, and &SHOULD; require explicit user confirmation.

   proxy-revalidate
  <list><t>
      The proxy-revalidate directive has the same meaning as the must-revalidate
      directive, except that it does not apply to non-shared
      user agent caches. It can be used on a response to an
      authenticated request to permit the user's cache to store and
      later return the response without needing to revalidate it (since
      it has already been authenticated once by that user), while still
      requiring proxies that service many users to revalidate each time
      (in order to make sure that each user has been authenticated).
      Note that such authenticated responses also need the public cache
      control directive in order to allow them to be cached at all.

   no-transform
  <list><t>
      Implementors of intermediate caches (proxies) have found it useful
      to convert the media type of certain entity bodies. A non-transparent
      proxy might, for example, convert between image
      formats in order to save cache space or to reduce the amount of
      traffic on a slow link.
  </t><t>
      Serious operational problems occur, however, when these
      transformations are applied to entity bodies intended for certain
      kinds of applications. For example, applications for medical
      imaging, scientific data analysis and those using end-to-end
      authentication, all depend on receiving an entity body that is bit
      for bit identical to the original entity-body.
  </t><t>
      Therefore, if a message includes the no-transform directive, an
      intermediate cache or proxy &MUST-NOT; change those headers that are
      listed in <xref target="non-modifiable.headers"/> as being subject to the no-transform
      directive. This implies that the cache or proxy &MUST-NOT; change
      any aspect of the entity-body that is specified by these headers,
      including the value of the entity-body itself.

<section title="Cache Control Extensions" anchor="cache.control.extensions">
<t>
   The Cache-Control header field can be extended through the use of one
   or more cache-extension tokens, each with an optional assigned value.
   Informational extensions (those which do not require a change in
   cache behavior) &MAY; be added without changing the semantics of other
   directives. Behavioral extensions are designed to work by acting as
   modifiers to the existing base of cache directives. Both the new
   directive and the standard directive are supplied, such that
   applications which do not understand the new directive will default
   to the behavior specified by the standard directive, and those that
   understand the new directive will recognize it as modifying the
   requirements associated with the standard directive. In this way,
   extensions to the cache-control directives can be made without
   requiring changes to the base protocol.
</t>
<t>
   This extension mechanism depends on an HTTP cache obeying all of the
   cache-control directives defined for its native HTTP-version, obeying
   certain extensions, and ignoring all directives that it does not
   understand.
</t>
<t>
   For example, consider a hypothetical new response directive called
   community which acts as a modifier to the private directive. We
   define this new directive to mean that, in addition to any non-shared
   cache, any cache which is shared only by members of the community
   named within its value may cache the response. An origin server
   wishing to allow the UCI community to use an otherwise private
   response in their shared cache(s) could do so by including
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
    Cache-Control: private, community="UCI"
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   A cache seeing this header field will act correctly even if the cache
   does not understand the community cache-extension, since it will also
   see and understand the private directive and thus default to the safe
   behavior.
</t>
<t>
   Unrecognized cache-directives &MUST; be ignored; it is assumed that any
   cache-directive likely to be unrecognized by an HTTP/1.1 cache will
   be combined with standard directives (or the response's default
   cacheability) such that the cache behavior will remain minimally
   correct even if the cache does not understand the extension(s).

   The Connection general-header field allows the sender to specify

<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="Connection"/><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="connection-token"/>
    Connection = "Connection" ":" 1#(connection-token)

<t>
   HTTP/1.1 proxies &MUST; parse the Connection header field before a
   message is forwarded and, for each connection-token in this field,
   remove any header field(s) from the message with the same name as the
   connection-token. Connection options are signaled by the presence of
   a connection-token in the Connection header field, not by any
   corresponding additional header field(s), since the additional header
   field may not be sent if there are no parameters associated with that
   connection option.
</t>
<t>
   Message headers listed in the Connection header &MUST-NOT; include
   end-to-end headers, such as Cache-Control.
</t>
<t>
   HTTP/1.1 defines the "close" connection option for the sender to
   signal that the connection will be closed after completion of the
   response. For example,
</t>

<t>
   HTTP/1.1 applications that do not support persistent connections &MUST;
   include the "close" connection option in every message.
</t>
<t>
   A system receiving an HTTP/1.0 (or lower-version) message that
   includes a Connection header MUST, for each connection-token in this
   field, remove and ignore any header field(s) from the message with

   The Content-Encoding entity-header field is used as a modifier to the
   media-type. When present, its value indicates what additional content
   codings have been applied to the entity-body, and thus what decoding

</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">

<t>
   The content-coding is a characteristic of the entity identified by
   the Request-URI. Typically, the entity-body is stored with this
   encoding and is only decoded before rendering or analogous usage.
   However, a non-transparent proxy &MAY; modify the content-coding if the
   new coding is known to be acceptable to the recipient, unless the
   "no-transform" cache-control directive is present in the message.

<t>
   If the content-coding of an entity is not "identity", then the

   appropriate field is
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">

<t>
   If no Content-Language is specified, the default is that the content
   is intended for all language audiences. This might mean that the
   sender does not consider it to be specific to any natural language,
   or that the sender does not know for which language it is intended.
</t>

   Multiple languages &MAY; be listed for content that is intended for
   multiple audiences. For example, a rendition of the "Treaty of

   However, just because multiple languages are present within an entity
   does not mean that it is intended for multiple linguistic audiences.
   An example would be a beginner's language primer, such as "A First
   Lesson in Latin," which is clearly intended to be used by an
   English-literate audience. In this case, the Content-Language would

   The value of Content-Location also defines the base URI for the

   The Content-Location value is not a replacement for the original

   A cache cannot assume that an entity with a Content-Location

<t>
   The Content-MD5 entity-header field, as defined in RFC 1864 <xref target="RFC1864"/>, is
   an MD5 digest of the entity-body for the purpose of providing an
   end-to-end message integrity check (MIC) of the entity-body. (Note: a
   MIC is good for detecting accidental modification of the entity-body
   in transit, but is not proof against malicious attacks.)
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="Content-MD5"/><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="md5-digest"/>
     Content-MD5   = "Content-MD5" ":" md5-digest
     md5-digest   = &lt;base64 of 128 bit MD5 digest as per RFC 1864&gt;
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   The Content-MD5 header field &MAY; be generated by an origin server or
   client to function as an integrity check of the entity-body. Only
   origin servers or clients &MAY; generate the Content-MD5 header field;
   proxies and gateways &MUST-NOT; generate it, as this would defeat its
   value as an end-to-end integrity check. Any recipient of the entity-body,
   including gateways and proxies, &MAY; check that the digest value
   in this header field matches that of the entity-body as received.
</t>
<t>
   The MD5 digest is computed based on the content of the entity-body,
   including any content-coding that has been applied, but not including
   any transfer-encoding applied to the message-body. If the message is
   received with a transfer-encoding, that encoding &MUST; be removed
   prior to checking the Content-MD5 value against the received entity.
</t>
<t>
   This has the result that the digest is computed on the octets of the
   entity-body exactly as, and in the order that, they would be sent if
   no transfer-encoding were being applied.
</t>
<t>
   HTTP extends RFC 1864 to permit the digest to be computed for MIME
   composite media-types (e.g., multipart/* and message/rfc822), but
   this does not change how the digest is computed as defined in the
   preceding paragraph.
</t>
<t>
   There are several consequences of this. The entity-body for composite
   types &MAY; contain many body-parts, each with its own MIME and HTTP
   headers (including Content-MD5, Content-Transfer-Encoding, and
   Content-Encoding headers). If a body-part has a Content-Transfer-Encoding
   or Content-Encoding header, it is assumed that the content
   of the body-part has had the encoding applied, and the body-part is
   included in the Content-MD5 digest as is -- i.e., after the
   application. The Transfer-Encoding header field is not allowed within
   body-parts.
</t>
<t>
   Conversion of all line breaks to CRLF &MUST-NOT; be done before
   computing or checking the digest: the line break convention used in
   the text actually transmitted &MUST; be left unaltered when computing
   the digest.
  <list><t>
      <x:h>Note:</x:h> while the definition of Content-MD5 is exactly the same for
      HTTP as in RFC 1864 for MIME entity-bodies, there are several ways
      in which the application of Content-MD5 to HTTP entity-bodies
      differs from its application to MIME entity-bodies. One is that
      HTTP, unlike MIME, does not use Content-Transfer-Encoding, and
      does use Transfer-Encoding and Content-Encoding. Another is that
      HTTP more frequently uses binary content types than MIME, so it is
      worth noting that, in such cases, the byte order used to compute
      the digest is the transmission byte order defined for the type.
      Lastly, HTTP allows transmission of text types with any of several
      line break conventions and not just the canonical form using CRLF.

<t>
   The Content-Range entity-header is sent with a partial entity-body to
   specify where in the full entity-body the partial body should be
   applied. Range units are defined in <xref target="range.units"/>.

    instance-length           = 1*<x:ref>DIGIT</x:ref>
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   The header &SHOULD; indicate the total length of the full entity-body,
   unless this length is unknown or difficult to determine. The asterisk
   "*" character means that the instance-length is unknown at the time
   when the response was generated.
</t>
<t>
   Unlike byte-ranges-specifier values (see <xref target="byte.ranges"/>), a byte-range-resp-spec
   &MUST; only specify one range, and &MUST; contain
   absolute byte positions for both the first and last byte of the
   range.
</t>
<t>
   A byte-content-range-spec with a byte-range-resp-spec whose last-byte-pos
   value is less than its first-byte-pos value, or whose
   instance-length value is less than or equal to its last-byte-pos
   value, is invalid. The recipient of an invalid byte-content-range-spec
   &MUST; ignore it and any content transferred along with it.
</t>
<t>
   A server sending a response with status code 416 (Requested range not
   satisfiable) &SHOULD; include a Content-Range field with a byte-range-resp-spec
   of "*". The instance-length specifies the current length of
   the selected resource. A response with status code 206 (Partial
   Content) &MUST-NOT; include a Content-Range field with a byte-range-resp-spec of "*".
</t>
<t>

   contains a total of 1234 bytes:

   When an HTTP message includes the content of a single range (for
   example, a response to a request for a single range, or to a request
   for a set of ranges that overlap without any holes), this content is
   transmitted with a Content-Range header, and a Content-Length header
   showing the number of bytes actually transferred. For example,
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
    HTTP/1.1 206 Partial content

    Content-Length: 26012
    Content-Type: image/gif
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   When an HTTP message includes the content of multiple ranges (for
   example, a response to a request for multiple non-overlapping
   ranges), these are transmitted as a multipart message. The multipart
   media type used for this purpose is "multipart/byteranges" as defined
   in <xref target="internet.media.type.multipart.byteranges"/>. See <xref target="changes.from.rfc.2068"/> for a compatibility issue.
</t>
<t>
   A response to a request for a single range &MUST-NOT; be sent using the
   multipart/byteranges media type.  A response to a request for
   multiple ranges, whose result is a single range, &MAY; be sent as a
   multipart/byteranges media type with one part. A client that cannot
   decode a multipart/byteranges message &MUST-NOT; ask for multiple
   byte-ranges in a single request.
</t>
<t>
   When a client requests multiple byte-ranges in one request, the
   server &SHOULD; return them in the order that they appeared in the
   request.
</t>
<t>
   If the server ignores a byte-range-spec because it is syntactically
   invalid, the server &SHOULD; treat the request as if the invalid Range
   header field did not exist. (Normally, this means return a 200
   response containing the full entity).
</t>
<t>
   If the server receives a request (other than one including an If-Range
   request-header field) with an unsatisfiable Range request-header
   field (that is, all of whose byte-range-spec values have a
   first-byte-pos value greater than the current length of the selected
   resource), it &SHOULD; return a response code of 416 (Requested range
   not satisfiable) (<xref target="status.416"/>).
  <list><t>
      <x:h>Note:</x:h> clients cannot depend on servers to send a <x:ref>416 (Requested range not satisfiable)</x:ref>
      response instead of a <x:ref>200 (OK)</x:ref> response for

</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
    GET /pub/WWW/ HTTP/1.1
    Host: www.w3.org
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   A client &MUST; include a Host header field in all HTTP/1.1 request
   messages . If the requested URI does not include an Internet host
   name for the service being requested, then the Host header field &MUST;
   be given with an empty value. An HTTP/1.1 proxy &MUST; ensure that any
   request message it forwards does contain an appropriate Host header
   field that identifies the service being requested by the proxy. All
   Internet-based HTTP/1.1 servers &MUST; respond with a <x:ref>400 (Bad Request)</x:ref>
   status code to any HTTP/1.1 request message which lacks a Host header

<t>
   The If-Match request-header field is used with a method to make it
   conditional. A client that has one or more entities previously
   obtained from the resource can verify that one of those entities is
   current by including a list of their associated entity tags in the
   If-Match header field. Entity tags are defined in <xref target="entity.tags"/>. The
   purpose of this feature is to allow efficient updates of cached
   information with a minimum amount of transaction overhead. It is also
   used, on updating requests, to prevent inadvertent modification of
   the wrong version of a resource. As a special case, the value "*"
   matches any current entity of the resource.
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="If-Match"/>
    If-Match = "If-Match" ":" ( "*" | 1#<x:ref>entity-tag</x:ref> )

<t>
   If any of the entity tags match the entity tag of the entity that
   would have been returned in the response to a similar GET request
   (without the If-Match header) on that resource, or if "*" is given
   and any current entity exists for that resource, then the server &MAY;
   perform the requested method as if the If-Match header field did not
   exist.
</t>
<t>
   A server &MUST; use the strong comparison function (see <xref target="weak.and.strong.validators"/>)
   to compare the entity tags in If-Match.
</t>
<t>
   If none of the entity tags match, or if "*" is given and no current
   entity exists, the server &MUST-NOT; perform the requested method, and
   &MUST; return a <x:ref>412 (Precondition Failed)</x:ref> response. This behavior is
   most useful when the client wants to prevent an updating method, such
   as PUT, from modifying a resource that has changed since the client
   last retrieved it.
</t>
<t>
   If the request would, without the If-Match header field, result in
   anything other than a 2xx or 412 status, then the If-Match header
   &MUST; be ignored.
</t>
<t>
   The meaning of "If-Match: *" is that the method &SHOULD; be performed
   if the representation selected by the origin server (or by a cache,
   possibly using the Vary mechanism, see <xref target="header.vary"/>) exists, and
   &MUST-NOT; be performed if the representation does not exist.
</t>
<t>
   A request intended to update a resource (e.g., a PUT) &MAY; include an
   If-Match header field to signal that the request method &MUST-NOT; be
   applied if the entity corresponding to the If-Match value (a single
   entity tag) is no longer a representation of that resource. This
   allows the user to indicate that they do not wish the request to be
   successful if the resource has been changed without their knowledge.
   Examples:
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">

<t>
   The If-Modified-Since request-header field is used with a method to
   make it conditional: if the requested variant has not been modified

   A GET method with an If-Modified-Since header and no Range header

      <x:h>Note:</x:h> When handling an If-Modified-Since header field, some
      servers will use an exact date comparison function, rather than a
      less-than function, for deciding whether to send a 304 (Not
      Modified) response. To get best results when sending an If-Modified-Since
      header field for cache validation, clients are
      advised to use the exact date string received in a previous Last-Modified
      header field whenever possible.
    </t><t>
      <x:h>Note:</x:h> If a client uses an arbitrary date in the If-Modified-Since
      header instead of a date taken from the Last-Modified header for
      the same request, the client should be aware of the fact that this
      date is interpreted in the server's understanding of time. The
      client should consider unsynchronized clocks and rounding problems
      due to the different encodings of time between the client and
      server. This includes the possibility of race conditions if the
      document has changed between the time it was first requested and
      the If-Modified-Since date of a subsequent request, and the
      possibility of clock-skew-related problems if the If-Modified-Since
      date is derived from the client's clock without correction
      to the server's clock. Corrections for different time bases
      between client and server are at best approximate due to network
      latency.

<t>
   The If-None-Match request-header field is used with a method to make
   it conditional. A client that has one or more entities previously
   obtained from the resource can verify that none of those entities is
   current by including a list of their associated entity tags in the
   If-None-Match header field. The purpose of this feature is to allow
   efficient updates of cached information with a minimum amount of
   transaction overhead. It is also used to prevent a method (e.g. PUT)
   from inadvertently modifying an existing resource when the client
   believes that the resource does not exist.

   If any of the entity tags match the entity tag of the entity that
   would have been returned in the response to a similar GET request
   (without the If-None-Match header) on that resource, or if "*" is
   given and any current entity exists for that resource, then the
   server &MUST-NOT; perform the requested method, unless required to do
   so because the resource's modification date fails to match that
   supplied in an If-Modified-Since header field in the request.
   Instead, if the request method was GET or HEAD, the server &SHOULD;
   respond with a <x:ref>304 (Not Modified)</x:ref> response, including the cache-related
   header fields (particularly ETag) of one of the entities that
   matched. For all other request methods, the server &MUST; respond with

</t>
<t>
   If none of the entity tags match, then the server &MAY; perform the
   requested method as if the If-None-Match header field did not exist,
   but &MUST; also ignore any If-Modified-Since header field(s) in the
   request. That is, if no entity tags match, then the server &MUST-NOT;
   return a <x:ref>304 (Not Modified)</x:ref> response.
</t>
<t>
   If the request would, without the If-None-Match header field, result
   in anything other than a 2xx or 304 status, then the If-None-Match
   header &MUST; be ignored. (See <xref target="rules.for.when.to.use.entity.tags.and.last-modified.dates"/> for a discussion of
   server behavior when both If-Modified-Since and If-None-Match appear
   in the same request.)
</t>
<t>
   The meaning of "If-None-Match: *" is that the method &MUST-NOT; be

<t>
   If a client has a partial copy of an entity in its cache, and wishes
   to have an up-to-date copy of the entire entity in its cache, it
   could use the Range request-header with a conditional GET (using
   either or both of If-Unmodified-Since and If-Match.) However, if the
   condition fails because the entity has been modified, the client
   would then have to make a second request to obtain the entire current
   entity-body.
</t>
<t>
   The If-Range header allows a client to "short-circuit" the second
   request. Informally, its meaning is `if the entity is unchanged, send
   me the part(s) that I am missing; otherwise, send me the entire new
   entity'.

   If the client has no entity tag for an entity, but does have a Last-Modified
   date, it &MAY; use that date in an If-Range header. (The
   server can distinguish between a valid HTTP-date and any form of
   entity-tag by examining no more than two characters.) The If-Range
   header &SHOULD; only be used together with a Range header, and &MUST; be
   ignored if the request does not include a Range header, or if the
   server does not support the sub-range operation.
</t>
<t>
   If the entity tag given in the If-Range header matches the current

   since the time specified in this field, the server &SHOULD; perform the
   requested operation as if the If-Unmodified-Since header were not

<t>
   The exact meaning of this header field depends on the implementation
   of the origin server and the nature of the original resource. For
   files, it may be just the file system last-modified time. For
   entities with dynamically included parts, it may be the most recent
   of the set of last-modify times for its component parts. For database
   gateways, it may be the last-update time stamp of the record. For
   virtual objects, it may be the last time the internal state changed.
</t>
<t>
   An origin server &MUST-NOT; send a Last-Modified date which is later
   than the server's time of message origination. In such cases, where
   the resource's last modification would indicate some time in the
   future, the server &MUST; replace that date with the message
   origination date.
</t>
<t>
   An origin server &SHOULD; obtain the Last-Modified value of the entity
   as close as possible to the time that it generates the Date value of
   its response. This allows a recipient to make an accurate assessment
   of the entity's modification time, especially if the entity changes

   responses, the Location is that of the new resource which was created

<t>
   The Max-Forwards request-header field provides a mechanism with the
   TRACE (<xref target="TRACE"/>) and OPTIONS (<xref target="OPTIONS"/>) methods to limit the
   number of proxies or gateways that can forward the request to the
   next inbound server. This can be useful when the client is attempting

<t>
   Each proxy or gateway recipient of a TRACE or OPTIONS request

   (0), the recipient &MUST-NOT; forward the request; instead, it &MUST;

   The Pragma general-header field is used to include implementation-specific
   directives that might apply to any recipient along the

   HTTP/1.0. Clients &SHOULD; include both header fields when a no-cache
   request is sent to a server not known to be HTTP/1.1 compliant.

<t>
   Pragma directives &MUST; be passed through by a proxy or gateway
   application, regardless of their significance to that application,

   specific recipient; however, any pragma directive not relevant to a
   recipient &SHOULD; be ignored by that recipient.

<t>
   Since all HTTP entities are represented in HTTP messages as sequences
   of bytes, the concept of a byte range is meaningful for any HTTP
   entity. (However, not all clients and servers need to support byte-range
   operations.)
</t>
<t>
   Byte range specifications in HTTP apply to the sequence of bytes in
   the entity-body (not necessarily the same as the message-body).
</t>
<t>
   A byte range operation &MAY; specify a single range of bytes, or a set
   of ranges within a single entity.

    first-byte-pos  = 1*<x:ref>DIGIT</x:ref>
    last-byte-pos   = 1*<x:ref>DIGIT</x:ref>
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   The first-byte-pos value in a byte-range-spec gives the byte-offset
   of the first byte in a range. The last-byte-pos value gives the
   byte-offset of the last byte in the range; that is, the byte
   positions specified are inclusive. Byte offsets start at zero.
</t>
<t>
   If the last-byte-pos value is present, it &MUST; be greater than or
   equal to the first-byte-pos in that byte-range-spec, or the byte-range-spec
   is syntactically invalid. The recipient of a byte-range-set
   that includes one or more syntactically invalid byte-range-spec
   values &MUST; ignore the header field that includes that byte-range-set.
</t>
<t>
   If the last-byte-pos value is absent, or if the value is greater than
   or equal to the current length of the entity-body, last-byte-pos is
   taken to be equal to one less than the current length of the entity-body
   in bytes.
</t>
<t>
   By its choice of last-byte-pos, a client can limit the number of
   bytes retrieved without knowing the size of the entity.
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="suffix-byte-range-spec"/><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="suffix-length"/>
    suffix-byte-range-spec = "-" suffix-length
    suffix-length = 1*<x:ref>DIGIT</x:ref>
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   A suffix-byte-range-spec is used to specify the suffix of the
   entity-body, of a length given by the suffix-length value. (That is,
   this form specifies the last N bytes of an entity-body.) If the
   entity is shorter than the specified suffix-length, the entire
   entity-body is used.
</t>
<t>
   If a syntactically valid byte-range-set includes at least one byte-range-spec
   whose first-byte-pos is less than the current length of
   the entity-body, or at least one suffix-byte-range-spec with a non-zero
   suffix-length, then the byte-range-set is satisfiable.
   Otherwise, the byte-range-set is unsatisfiable. If the byte-range-set
   is unsatisfiable, the server &SHOULD; return a response with a status
   of <x:ref>416 (Requested range not satisfiable)</x:ref>. Otherwise, the server
   &SHOULD; return a response with a status of <x:ref>206 (Partial Content)</x:ref>
   containing the satisfiable ranges of the entity-body.
</t>
<t>
   Examples of byte-ranges-specifier values (assuming an entity-body of
   length 10000):
  <list style="symbols">
     <t>The first 500 bytes (byte offsets 0-499, inclusive):  bytes=0-499</t>

<section title="Range Retrieval Requests" anchor="range.retrieval.requests">
<t>
   HTTP retrieval requests using conditional or unconditional GET
   methods &MAY; request one or more sub-ranges of the entity, instead of
   the entire entity, using the Range request header, which applies to
   the entity returned as the result of the request:
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="Range"/>
   Range = "Range" ":" ranges-specifier
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   A server &MAY; ignore the Range header. However, HTTP/1.1 origin
   servers and intermediate caches ought to support byte ranges when
   possible, since Range supports efficient recovery from partially
   failed transfers, and supports efficient partial retrieval of large
   entities.
</t>
<t>
   If the server supports the Range header and the specified range or
   ranges are appropriate for the entity:
  <list style="symbols">
     <t>The presence of a Range header in an unconditional GET modifies
        what is returned if the GET is otherwise successful. In other
        words, the response carries a status code of 206 (Partial
        Content) instead of <x:ref>200 (OK)</x:ref>.</t>

     <t>The presence of a Range header in a conditional GET (a request
        using one or both of If-Modified-Since and If-None-Match, or
        one or both of If-Unmodified-Since and If-Match) modifies what
        is returned if the GET is otherwise successful and the

</t>
<t>
   In some cases, it might be more appropriate to use the If-Range
   header (see <xref target="header.if-range"/>) in addition to the Range header.
</t>
<t>
   If a proxy that supports ranges receives a Range request, forwards
   the request to an inbound server, and receives an entire entity in
   reply, it &SHOULD; only return the requested range to its client. It

   logging, optimized caching, etc. It also allows obsolete or mistyped
   links to be traced for maintenance. The Referer field &MUST-NOT; be

   The Retry-After response-header field can be used with a 503 (Service

   be unavailable to the requesting client. This field &MAY; also be used
   with any 3xx (Redirection) response to indicate the minimum time the

   The TE request-header field indicates what extension transfer-codings
   it is willing to accept in the response and whether or not it is
   willing to accept trailer fields in a chunked transfer-coding. Its
   value may consist of the keyword "trailers" and/or a comma-separated

    t-codings = "trailers" | ( transfer-extension [ accept-params ] )
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   The presence of the keyword "trailers" indicates that the client is
   willing to accept trailer fields in a chunked transfer-coding, as
   defined in <xref target="chunked.transfer.encoding"/>. This keyword is reserved for use with
   transfer-coding values even though it does not itself represent a
   transfer-coding.

   Examples of its use are:
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">

</artwork></figure>
<t>
   The TE header field only applies to the immediate connection.
   Therefore, the keyword &MUST; be supplied within a Connection header
   field (<xref target="header.connection"/>) whenever TE is present in an HTTP/1.1 message.
</t>
<t>
   A server tests whether a transfer-coding is acceptable, according to
   a TE field, using these rules:
  <list style="numbers">
    <x:lt>
      <t>The "chunked" transfer-coding is always acceptable. If the

         that, if given, the client is stating that either all
         downstream clients are willing to accept trailer fields in the
         forwarded response, or that it will attempt to buffer the
         response on behalf of downstream recipients.
      </t><t>
         <x:h>Note:</x:h> HTTP/1.1 does not define any means to limit the size of a

    <x:lt>
      <t>If multiple transfer-codings are acceptable, then the

<t>
   An HTTP/1.1 message &SHOULD; include a Trailer header field in a

   If no Trailer header field is present, the trailer &SHOULD-NOT;  include

<t>
   The Transfer-Encoding general-header field indicates what (if any)
   type of transformation has been applied to the message body in order
   to safely transfer it between the sender and the recipient. This
   differs from the content-coding in that the transfer-coding is a

  <iref primary="true" item="Upgrade header" x:for-anchor=""/>
  <iref primary="true" item="Headers" subitem="Upgrade" x:for-anchor=""/>
<t>
   The Upgrade general-header allows the client to specify what
   additional communication protocols it supports and would like to use
   if the server finds it appropriate to switch protocols. The server
   &MUST; use the Upgrade header field within a <x:ref>101 (Switching Protocols)</x:ref>
   response to indicate which protocol(s) are being switched.
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="Upgrade"/>
    Upgrade        = "Upgrade" ":" 1#<x:ref>product</x:ref>

<t>
   For example,
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
    Upgrade: HTTP/2.0, SHTTP/1.3, IRC/6.9, RTA/x11
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   The Upgrade header field is intended to provide a simple mechanism
   for transition from HTTP/1.1 to some other, incompatible protocol. It
   does so by allowing the client to advertise its desire to use another
   protocol, such as a later version of HTTP with a higher major version
   number, even though the current request has been made using HTTP/1.1.
   This eases the difficult transition between incompatible protocols by
   allowing the client to initiate a request in the more commonly
   supported protocol while indicating to the server that it would like
   to use a "better" protocol if available (where "better" is determined
   by the server, possibly according to the nature of the method and/or
   resource being requested).
</t>
<t>
   The Upgrade header field only applies to switching application-layer
   protocols upon the existing transport-layer connection. Upgrade
   cannot be used to insist on a protocol change; its acceptance and use
   by the server is optional. The capabilities and nature of the
   application-layer communication after the protocol change is entirely
   dependent upon the new protocol chosen, although the first action
   after changing the protocol &MUST; be a response to the initial HTTP
   request containing the Upgrade header field.
</t>
<t>
   The Upgrade header field only applies to the immediate connection.
   Therefore, the upgrade keyword &MUST; be supplied within a Connection
   header field (<xref target="header.connection"/>) whenever Upgrade is present in an
   HTTP/1.1 message.
</t>
<t>
   The Upgrade header field cannot be used to indicate a switch to a
   protocol on a different connection. For that purpose, it is more
   appropriate to use a 301, 302, 303, or 305 redirection response.
</t>
<t>
   This specification only defines the protocol name "HTTP" for use by
   the family of Hypertext Transfer Protocols, as defined by the HTTP
   version rules of <xref target="http.version"/> and future updates to this
   specification. Any token can be used as a protocol name; however, it
   will only be useful if both the client and server associate the name
   with the same protocol.

<t>
   The User-Agent request-header field contains information about the
   user agent originating the request. This is for statistical purposes,
   the tracing of protocol violations, and automated recognition of user
   agents for the sake of tailoring responses to avoid particular user
   agent limitations. User agents &SHOULD; include this field with

<t>
   The Vary field value indicates the set of request-header fields that
   fully determines, while the response is fresh, whether a cache is
   permitted to use the response to reply to a subsequent request
   without revalidation. For uncacheable or stale responses, the Vary
   field value advises the user agent about the criteria that were used
   to select the representation. A Vary field value of "*" implies that
   a cache cannot determine from the request headers of a subsequent
   request whether this response is the appropriate representation. See
   <xref target="caching.negotiated.responses"/> for use of the Vary header field by caches.
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="Vary"/>
    Vary  = "Vary" ":" ( "*" | 1#<x:ref>field-name</x:ref> )
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   An HTTP/1.1 server &SHOULD; include a Vary header field with any
   cacheable response that is subject to server-driven negotiation.
   Doing so allows a cache to properly interpret future requests on that
   resource and informs the user agent about the presence of negotiation
   on that resource. A server &MAY; include a Vary header field with a
   non-cacheable response that is subject to server-driven negotiation,
   since this might provide the user agent with useful information about
   the dimensions over which the response varies at the time of the
   response.
</t>
<t>
   A Vary field value consisting of a list of field-names signals that
   the representation selected for the response is based on a selection
   algorithm which considers ONLY the listed request-header field values
   in selecting the most appropriate representation. A cache &MAY; assume
   that the same selection will be made for future requests with the
   same values for the listed field names, for the duration of time for
   which the response is fresh.
</t>
<t>
   The field-names given are not limited to the set of standard
   request-header fields defined by this specification. Field names are
   case-insensitive.
</t>
<t>
   A Vary field value of "*" signals that unspecified parameters not
   limited to the request-headers (e.g., the network address of the
   client), play a role in the selection of the response representation.
   The "*" value &MUST-NOT; be generated by a proxy server; it may only be

   The Via general-header field &MUST; be used by gateways and proxies to
   indicate the intermediate protocols and recipients between the user
   agent and the server on requests, and between the origin server and
   the client on responses. It is analogous to the "Received" field of
   RFC 822 <xref target="RFC822"/> and is intended to be used for tracking message forwards,

<t>
   The received-protocol indicates the protocol version of the message
   received by the server or client along each segment of the
   request/response chain. The received-protocol version is appended to
   the Via field value when the message is forwarded so that information
   about the protocol capabilities of upstream applications remains
   visible to all recipients.
</t>
<t>
   The protocol-name is optional if and only if it would be "HTTP". The
   received-by field is normally the host and optional port number of a
   recipient server or client that subsequently forwarded the message.
   However, if the real host is considered to be sensitive information,
   it &MAY; be replaced by a pseudonym. If the port is not given, it &MAY;
   be assumed to be the default port of the received-protocol.
</t>
<t>
   Multiple Via field values represents each proxy or gateway that has
   forwarded the message. Each recipient &MUST; append its information
   such that the end result is ordered according to the sequence of
   forwarding applications.
</t>
<t>
   Comments &MAY; be used in the Via header field to identify the software
   of the recipient proxy or gateway, analogous to the User-Agent and
   Server header fields. However, all comments in the Via field are
   optional and &MAY; be removed by any recipient prior to forwarding the
   message.
</t>
<t>
   For example, a request message could be sent from an HTTP/1.0 user
   agent to an internal proxy code-named "fred", which uses HTTP/1.1 to
   forward the request to a public proxy at nowhere.com, which completes
   the request by forwarding it to the origin server at www.ics.uci.edu.
   The request received by www.ics.uci.edu would then have the following
   Via header field:
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
    Via: 1.0 fred, 1.1 nowhere.com (Apache/1.1)
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   Proxies and gateways used as a portal through a network firewall
   &SHOULD-NOT;, by default, forward the names and ports of hosts within
   the firewall region. This information &SHOULD; only be propagated if
   explicitly enabled. If not enabled, the received-by host of any host
   behind the firewall &SHOULD; be replaced by an appropriate pseudonym
   for that host.
</t>
<t>
   For organizations that have strong privacy requirements for hiding
   internal structures, a proxy &MAY; combine an ordered subsequence of
   Via header field entries with identical received-protocol values into
   a single such entry. For example,
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
    Via: 1.0 ricky, 1.1 ethel, 1.1 fred, 1.0 lucy
</artwork></figure>
<t>
        could be collapsed to
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
    Via: 1.0 ricky, 1.1 mertz, 1.0 lucy
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   Applications &SHOULD-NOT;  combine multiple entries unless they are all
   under the same organizational control and the hosts have already been
   replaced by pseudonyms. Applications &MUST-NOT; combine entries which
   have different received-protocol values.

   The Warning general-header field is used to carry additional
   information about the status or transformation of a message which
   might not be reflected in the message. This information is typically
   used to warn about a possible lack of semantic transparency from
   caching operations or transformations applied to the entity body of
   the message.
</t>
<t>
   Warning headers are sent with responses using:

</artwork></figure>
<t>
   A response &MAY; carry more than one Warning header.
</t>
<t>
   The warn-text &SHOULD; be in a natural language and character set that
   is most likely to be intelligible to the human user receiving the
   response. This decision &MAY; be based on any available knowledge, such
   as the location of the cache or user, the Accept-Language field in a
   request, the Content-Language field in a response, etc. The default
   language is English and the default character set is ISO-8859-1.
</t>
<t>
   If a character set other than ISO-8859-1 is used, it &MUST; be encoded
   in the warn-text using the method described in RFC 2047 <xref target="RFC2047"/>.
</t>
<t>
   Warning headers can in general be applied to any message, however
   some specific warn-codes are specific to caches and can only be
   applied to response messages. New Warning headers &SHOULD; be added
   after any existing Warning headers. A cache &MUST-NOT; delete any
   Warning header that it received with a message. However, if a cache
   successfully validates a cache entry, it &SHOULD; remove any Warning
   headers previously attached to that entry except as specified for
   specific Warning codes. It &MUST; then add any Warning headers received
   in the validating response. In other words, Warning headers are those
   that would be attached to the most recent relevant response.
</t>
<t>
   When multiple Warning headers are attached to a response, the user
   agent ought to inform the user of as many of them as possible, in the
   order that they appear in the response. If it is not possible to
   inform the user of all of the warnings, the user agent &SHOULD; follow
   these heuristics:
  <list style="symbols">
    <t>Warnings that appear early in the response take priority over
        those appearing later in the response.</t>

    <t>Warnings in the user's preferred character set take priority
        over warnings in other character sets but with identical warn-codes
        and warn-agents.</t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   Systems that generate multiple Warning headers &SHOULD; order them with
   this user agent behavior in mind.

   Requirements for the behavior of caches with respect to Warnings are
   stated in <xref target="warnings"/>.

<section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security.considerations">
<t>
   This section is meant to inform application developers, information
   providers, and users of the security limitations in HTTP/1.1 as
   described by this document. The discussion does not include
   definitive solutions to the problems revealed, though it does make
   some suggestions for reducing security risks.
</t>

<section title="Personal Information" anchor="personal.information">
<t>
   HTTP clients are often privy to large amounts of personal information
   (e.g. the user's name, location, mail address, passwords, encryption
   keys, etc.), and &SHOULD; be very careful to prevent unintentional
   leakage of this information via the HTTP protocol to other sources.
   We very strongly recommend that a convenient interface be provided
   for the user to control dissemination of such information, and that
   designers and implementors be particularly careful in this area.
   History shows that errors in this area often create serious security
   and/or privacy problems and generate highly adverse publicity for the
   implementor's company.
</t>

<section title="Abuse of Server Log Information" anchor="abuse.of.server.log.information">
<t>
   A server is in the position to save personal data about a user's
   requests which might identify their reading patterns or subjects of
   interest. This information is clearly confidential in nature and its
   handling can be constrained by law in certain countries. People using
   the HTTP protocol to provide data are responsible for ensuring that
   such material is not distributed without the permission of any
   individuals that are identifiable by the published results.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Transfer of Sensitive Information" anchor="security.sensitive">
<t>
   Like any generic data transfer protocol, HTTP cannot regulate the
   content of the data that is transferred, nor is there any a priori
   method of determining the sensitivity of any particular piece of
   information within the context of any given request. Therefore,
   applications &SHOULD; supply as much control over this information as
   possible to the provider of that information. Four header fields are
   worth special mention in this context: Server, Via, Referer and From.
</t>
<t>
   Revealing the specific software version of the server might allow the
   server machine to become more vulnerable to attacks against software
   that is known to contain security holes. Implementors &SHOULD; make the
   Server header field a configurable option.
</t>
<t>
   Proxies which serve as a portal through a network firewall &SHOULD;
   take special precautions regarding the transfer of header information
   that identifies the hosts behind the firewall. In particular, they
   &SHOULD; remove, or replace with sanitized versions, any Via fields
   generated behind the firewall.
</t>
<t>
   The Referer header allows reading patterns to be studied and reverse
   links drawn. Although it can be very useful, its power can be abused
   if user details are not separated from the information contained in
   the Referer. Even when the personal information has been removed, the
   Referer header might indicate a private document's URI whose
   publication would be inappropriate.
</t>
<t>
   The information sent in the From field might conflict with the user's
   privacy interests or their site's security policy, and hence it
   &SHOULD-NOT;  be transmitted without the user being able to disable,
   enable, and modify the contents of the field. The user &MUST; be able
   to set the contents of this field within a user preference or
   application defaults configuration.
</t>
<t>
   We suggest, though do not require, that a convenient toggle interface
   be provided for the user to enable or disable the sending of From and
   Referer information.
</t>
<t>
   The User-Agent (<xref target="header.user-agent"/>) or Server (<xref target="header.server"/>) header
   fields can sometimes be used to determine that a specific client or
   server have a particular security hole which might be exploited.
   Unfortunately, this same information is often used for other valuable
   purposes for which HTTP currently has no better mechanism.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Encoding Sensitive Information in URI's" anchor="encoding.sensitive.information.in.uris">
<t>
   Because the source of a link might be private information or might
   reveal an otherwise private information source, it is strongly
   recommended that the user be able to select whether or not the
   Referer field is sent. For example, a browser client could have a
   toggle switch for browsing openly/anonymously, which would
   respectively enable/disable the sending of Referer and From
   information.
</t>
<t>
   Clients &SHOULD-NOT;  include a Referer header field in a (non-secure)
   HTTP request if the referring page was transferred with a secure
   protocol.
</t>
<t>
   Authors of services which use the HTTP protocol &SHOULD-NOT;  use GET
   based forms for the submission of sensitive data, because this will
   cause this data to be encoded in the Request-URI. Many existing
   servers, proxies, and user agents will log the request URI in some
   place where it might be visible to third parties. Servers can use
   POST-based form submission instead
</t>
</section>

<section title="Privacy Issues Connected to Accept Headers" anchor="privacy.issues.connected.to.accept.headers">
<t>
   Accept request-headers can reveal information about the user to all
   servers which are accessed. The Accept-Language header in particular
   can reveal information the user would consider to be of a private
   nature, because the understanding of particular languages is often
   strongly correlated to the membership of a particular ethnic group.
   User agents which offer the option to configure the contents of an
   Accept-Language header to be sent in every request are strongly
   encouraged to let the configuration process include a message which
   makes the user aware of the loss of privacy involved.
</t>
<t>
   An approach that limits the loss of privacy would be for a user agent
   to omit the sending of Accept-Language headers by default, and to ask
   the user whether or not to start sending Accept-Language headers to a
   server if it detects, by looking for any Vary response-header fields
   generated by the server, that such sending could improve the quality
   of service.
</t>
<t>
   Elaborate user-customized accept header fields sent in every request,
   in particular if these include quality values, can be used by servers
   as relatively reliable and long-lived user identifiers. Such user
   identifiers would allow content providers to do click-trail tracking,
   and would allow collaborating content providers to match cross-server
   click-trails or form submissions of individual users. Note that for
   many users not behind a proxy, the network address of the host
   running the user agent will also serve as a long-lived user
   identifier. In environments where proxies are used to enhance
   privacy, user agents ought to be conservative in offering accept
   header configuration options to end users. As an extreme privacy
   measure, proxies could filter the accept headers in relayed requests.
   General purpose user agents which provide a high degree of header
   configurability &SHOULD; warn users about the loss of privacy which can
   be involved.
</t>
</section>
</section>

<section title="Attacks Based On File and Path Names" anchor="attack.pathname">
<t>
   Implementations of HTTP origin servers &SHOULD; be careful to restrict
   the documents returned by HTTP requests to be only those that were
   intended by the server administrators. If an HTTP server translates
   HTTP URIs directly into file system calls, the server &MUST; take
   special care not to serve files that were not intended to be
   delivered to HTTP clients. For example, UNIX, Microsoft Windows, and
   other operating systems use ".." as a path component to indicate a
   directory level above the current one. On such a system, an HTTP
   server &MUST; disallow any such construct in the Request-URI if it
   would otherwise allow access to a resource outside those intended to
   be accessible via the HTTP server. Similarly, files intended for
   reference only internally to the server (such as access control
   files, configuration files, and script code) &MUST; be protected from
   inappropriate retrieval, since they might contain sensitive
   information. Experience has shown that minor bugs in such HTTP server
   implementations have turned into security risks.
</t>
</section>

<section title="DNS Spoofing" anchor="dns.spoofing">
<t>
   Clients using HTTP rely heavily on the Domain Name Service, and are
   thus generally prone to security attacks based on the deliberate
   mis-association of IP addresses and DNS names. Clients need to be
   cautious in assuming the continuing validity of an IP number/DNS name
   association.
</t>
<t>
   In particular, HTTP clients &SHOULD; rely on their name resolver for
   confirmation of an IP number/DNS name association, rather than
   caching the result of previous host name lookups. Many platforms
   already can cache host name lookups locally when appropriate, and
   they &SHOULD; be configured to do so. It is proper for these lookups to
   be cached, however, only when the TTL (Time To Live) information
   reported by the name server makes it likely that the cached
   information will remain useful.
</t>
<t>
   If HTTP clients cache the results of host name lookups in order to
   achieve a performance improvement, they &MUST; observe the TTL
   information reported by DNS.
</t>
<t>
   If HTTP clients do not observe this rule, they could be spoofed when
   a previously-accessed server's IP address changes. As network
   renumbering is expected to become increasingly common <xref target="RFC1900"/>, the
   possibility of this form of attack will grow. Observing this
   requirement thus reduces this potential security vulnerability.
</t>
<t>
   This requirement also improves the load-balancing behavior of clients
   for replicated servers using the same DNS name and reduces the
   likelihood of a user's experiencing failure in accessing sites which
   use that strategy.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Location Headers and Spoofing" anchor="location.spoofing">
<t>
   If a single server supports multiple organizations that do not trust
   one another, then it &MUST; check the values of Location and Content-Location
   headers in responses that are generated under control of
   said organizations to make sure that they do not attempt to
   invalidate resources over which they have no authority.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Content-Disposition Issues" anchor="content-disposition.issues">
<t>
   RFC 1806 <xref target="RFC1806"/>, from which the often implemented Content-Disposition
   (see <xref target="content-disposition"/>) header in HTTP is derived, has a number of very
   serious security considerations. Content-Disposition is not part of
   the HTTP standard, but since it is widely implemented, we are
   documenting its use and risks for implementors. See RFC 2183 <xref target="RFC2183"/>
   (which updates RFC 1806) for details.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Authentication Credentials and Idle Clients" anchor="auth.credentials.and.idle.clients">
<t>
   Existing HTTP clients and user agents typically retain authentication
   information indefinitely. HTTP/1.1. does not provide a method for a
   server to direct clients to discard these cached credentials. This is
   a significant defect that requires further extensions to HTTP.
   Circumstances under which credential caching can interfere with the
   application's security model include but are not limited to:
  <list style="symbols">
     <t>Clients which have been idle for an extended period following
        which the server might wish to cause the client to reprompt the
        user for credentials.</t>

     <t>Applications which include a session termination indication
        (such as a `logout' or `commit' button on a page) after which
        the server side of the application `knows' that there is no
        further reason for the client to retain the credentials.</t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   This is currently under separate study. There are a number of work-arounds
   to parts of this problem, and we encourage the use of
   password protection in screen savers, idle time-outs, and other
   methods which mitigate the security problems inherent in this
   problem. In particular, user agents which cache credentials are
   encouraged to provide a readily accessible mechanism for discarding
   cached credentials under user control.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Proxies and Caching" anchor="attack.proxies">
<t>
   By their very nature, HTTP proxies are men-in-the-middle, and
   represent an opportunity for man-in-the-middle attacks. Compromise of
   the systems on which the proxies run can result in serious security
   and privacy problems. Proxies have access to security-related
   information, personal information about individual users and
   organizations, and proprietary information belonging to users and
   content providers. A compromised proxy, or a proxy implemented or
   configured without regard to security and privacy considerations,
   might be used in the commission of a wide range of potential attacks.
</t>
<t>
   Proxy operators should protect the systems on which proxies run as
   they would protect any system that contains or transports sensitive
   information. In particular, log information gathered at proxies often
   contains highly sensitive personal information, and/or information
   about organizations. Log information should be carefully guarded, and
   appropriate guidelines for use developed and followed. (<xref target="abuse.of.server.log.information"/>).
</t>
<t>
   Caching proxies provide additional potential vulnerabilities, since
   the contents of the cache represent an attractive target for
   malicious exploitation. Because cache contents persist after an HTTP
   request is complete, an attack on the cache can reveal information
   long after a user believes that the information has been removed from
   the network. Therefore, cache contents should be protected as
   sensitive information.
</t>
<t>
   Proxy implementors should consider the privacy and security
   implications of their design and coding decisions, and of the
   configuration options they provide to proxy operators (especially the
   default configuration).
</t>
<t>
   Users of a proxy need to be aware that they are no trustworthier than
   the people who run the proxy; HTTP itself cannot solve this problem.
</t>
<t>
   The judicious use of cryptography, when appropriate, may suffice to
   protect against a broad range of security and privacy attacks. Such
   cryptography is beyond the scope of the HTTP/1.1 specification.

   Much of the content and presentation of the caching design is due to
   suggestions and comments from individuals including: Shel Kaphan,
   Paul Leach, Koen Holtman, David Morris, and Larry Masinter.
</t>
<t>
   Most of the specification of ranges is based on work originally done
   by Ari Luotonen and John Franks, with additional input from Steve
   Zilles.
</t>
<t>
   Thanks to the "cave men" of Palo Alto. You know who you are.
</t>
<t>
   Jim Gettys (the current editor of this document) wishes particularly
   to thank Roy Fielding, the previous editor of this document, along
   with John Klensin, Jeff Mogul, Paul Leach, Dave Kristol, Koen
   Holtman, John Franks, Josh Cohen, Alex Hopmann, Scott Lawrence, and
   Larry Masinter for their help. And thanks go particularly to Jeff
   Mogul and Scott Lawrence for performing the "MUST/MAY/SHOULD" audit.
</t>
<t>
   The Apache Group, Anselm Baird-Smith, author of Jigsaw, and Henrik
   Frystyk implemented RFC 2068 early, and we wish to thank them for the
   discovery of many of the problems that this document attempts to
   rectify.

<t>This document describes the Network Time Protocol (NTP), specifies its normal structure and summarizes information useful for its implementation. NTP provides the mechanisms to synchronize time and coordinate time distribution in a large, diverse internet operating at rates from mundane to lightwave. It uses a returnable-time design in which a distributed subnet of time servers operating in a self-organizing, hierarchical-master-slave configuration synchronizes local clocks within the subnet and to national time standards via wire or radio. The servers can also redistribute reference time via local routing algorithms and time daemons.</t></abstract></front>

<abstract>
<t>The protocol referred to as "HTTP/1.0" includes the specification for a Basic Access Authentication scheme.  This scheme is not considered to be a secure method of user authentication, as the user name and password are passed over the network as clear text.  A specification for a different authentication scheme is needed to address this severe limitation.  This document provides specification for such a scheme, referred to as "Digest Access Authentication".  Like Basic, Digest access authentication verifies that both parties to a communication know a shared secret (a password); unlike Basic, this verification can be done without sending the password in the clear, which is Basic's biggest weakness. As with most other authentication protocols, the greatest sources of risks are usually found not in the core protocol itself but in policies and procedures surrounding its use.</t></abstract></front>

<t>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. It is a generic, stateless, object-oriented protocol which can be used for many tasks, such as name servers and distributed object management systems, through extension of its request methods. A feature of HTTP is the typing and negotiation of data representation, allowing systems to be built independently of the data being transferred.</t>
<t>HTTP has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information initiative since 1990. This specification defines the protocol referred to as "HTTP/1.1".</t></abstract></front>

   HTTP request and response messages include an HTTP protocol version
   number.  Some confusion exists concerning the proper use and
   interpretation of HTTP version numbers, and concerning
   interoperability of HTTP implementations of different protocol
   versions.  This document is an attempt to clarify the situation.  It
   is not a modification of the intended meaning of the existing
   HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 documents, but it does describe the intention
   of the authors of those documents, and can be considered definitive
   when there is any ambiguity in those documents concerning HTTP
   version numbers, for all versions of HTTP.

<t>ISO/IEC 10646-1 defines a multi-octet character set called the Universal Character Set (UCS) which encompasses most of the world's writing systems. Multi-octet characters, however, are not compatible with many current applications and protocols, and this has led to the development of a few so-called UCS transformation formats (UTF), each with different characteristics.  UTF-8, the object of this memo, has the characteristic of preserving the full US-ASCII range, providing compatibility with file systems, parsers and other software that rely on US-ASCII values but are transparent to other values. This memo updates and replaces RFC 2044, in particular addressing the question of versions of the relevant standards.</t></abstract></front>

<section title="Tolerant Applications" anchor="tolerant.applications">
<t>
   Although this document specifies the requirements for the generation
   of HTTP/1.1 messages, not all applications will be correct in their
   implementation. We therefore recommend that operational applications
   be tolerant of deviations whenever those deviations can be
   interpreted unambiguously.
</t>
<t>
   Clients &SHOULD; be tolerant in parsing the Status-Line and servers
   tolerant when parsing the Request-Line. In particular, they &SHOULD;
   accept any amount of SP or HT characters between fields, even though
   only a single SP is required.
</t>
<t>
   The line terminator for message-header fields is the sequence CRLF.
   However, we recommend that applications, when parsing such headers,
   recognize a single LF as a line terminator and ignore the leading CR.
</t>
<t>
   The character set of an entity-body &SHOULD; be labeled as the lowest
   common denominator of the character codes used within that body, with
   the exception that not labeling the entity is preferred over labeling
   the entity with the labels US-ASCII or ISO-8859-1. See section <xref target="canonicalization.and.text.defaults" format="counter"/>
   and <xref target="missing.charset" format="counter"/>.
</t>
<t>
   Additional rules for requirements on parsing and encoding of dates
   and other potential problems with date encodings include:
</t>
<t>
  <list style="symbols">
     <t>HTTP/1.1 clients and caches &SHOULD; assume that an RFC-850 date
        which appears to be more than 50 years in the future is in fact
        in the past (this helps solve the "year 2000" problem).</t>

     <t>An HTTP/1.1 implementation &MAY; internally represent a parsed
        Expires date as earlier than the proper value, but &MUST-NOT;
        internally represent a parsed Expires date as later than the
        proper value.</t>

     <t>All expiration-related calculations &MUST; be done in GMT. The
        local time zone &MUST-NOT; influence the calculation or comparison
        of an age or expiration time.</t>

     <t>If an HTTP header incorrectly carries a date value with a time
        zone other than GMT, it &MUST; be converted into GMT using the
        most conservative possible conversion.</t>

<section title="Differences Between HTTP Entities and RFC 2045 Entities" anchor="differences.between.http.entities.and.rfc.2045.entities">
<t>
   HTTP/1.1 uses many of the constructs defined for Internet Mail (RFC
   822 <xref target="RFC822"/>) and the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME <xref target="RFC2045"/>) to
   allow entities to be transmitted in an open variety of
   representations and with extensible mechanisms. However, RFC 2045
   discusses mail, and HTTP has a few features that are different from
   those described in RFC 2045. These differences were carefully chosen
   to optimize performance over binary connections, to allow greater
   freedom in the use of new media types, to make date comparisons
   easier, and to acknowledge the practice of some early HTTP servers
   and clients.
</t>
<t>
   This appendix describes specific areas where HTTP differs from RFC
   2045. Proxies and gateways to strict MIME environments &SHOULD; be
   aware of these differences and provide the appropriate conversions
   where necessary. Proxies and gateways from MIME environments to HTTP
   also need to be aware of the differences because some conversions
   might be required.
</t>

<section title="MIME-Version" anchor="mime-version">
  <iref primary="true" item="MIME-Version header" x:for-anchor=""/>
  <iref primary="true" item="Headers" subitem="MIME-Version" x:for-anchor=""/>
  <x:anchor-alias value="MIME-Version"/>
<t>
   HTTP is not a MIME-compliant protocol. However, HTTP/1.1 messages &MAY;
   include a single MIME-Version general-header field to indicate what
   version of the MIME protocol was used to construct the message. Use
   of the MIME-Version header field indicates that the message is in
   full compliance with the MIME protocol (as defined in RFC 2045<xref target="RFC2045"/>).
   Proxies/gateways are responsible for ensuring full compliance (where
   possible) when exporting HTTP messages to strict MIME environments.
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="MIME-Version"/>
    MIME-Version   = "MIME-Version" ":" 1*<x:ref>DIGIT</x:ref> "." 1*<x:ref>DIGIT</x:ref>
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   MIME version "1.0" is the default for use in HTTP/1.1. However,
   HTTP/1.1 message parsing and semantics are defined by this document
   and not the MIME specification.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Conversion to Canonical Form" anchor="conversion.to.canonical.form">
<t>
   RFC 2045 <xref target="RFC2045"/> requires that an Internet mail entity be converted to
   canonical form prior to being transferred, as described in section <xref target="RFC2049" x:fmt="number" x:sec="4"/>
   of RFC 2049 <xref target="RFC2049"/>. <xref target="canonicalization.and.text.defaults"/> of this document describes the forms
   allowed for subtypes of the "text" media type when transmitted over
   HTTP. RFC 2046 requires that content with a type of "text" represent
   line breaks as CRLF and forbids the use of CR or LF outside of line
   break sequences. HTTP allows CRLF, bare CR, and bare LF to indicate a
   line break within text content when a message is transmitted over
   HTTP.
</t>
<t>
   Where it is possible, a proxy or gateway from HTTP to a strict MIME
   environment &SHOULD; translate all line breaks within the text media
   types described in <xref target="canonicalization.and.text.defaults"/> of this document to the RFC 2049
   canonical form of CRLF. Note, however, that this might be complicated
   by the presence of a Content-Encoding and by the fact that HTTP
   allows the use of some character sets which do not use octets 13 and
   10 to represent CR and LF, as is the case for some multi-byte
   character sets.
</t>
<t>
   Implementors should note that conversion will break any cryptographic
   checksums applied to the original content unless the original content
   is already in canonical form. Therefore, the canonical form is
   recommended for any content that uses such checksums in HTTP.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Conversion of Date Formats" anchor="conversion.of.date.formats">
<t>
   HTTP/1.1 uses a restricted set of date formats (<xref target="full.date"/>) to
   simplify the process of date comparison. Proxies and gateways from
   other protocols &SHOULD; ensure that any Date header field present in a
   message conforms to one of the HTTP/1.1 formats and rewrite the date
   if necessary.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Introduction of Content-Encoding" anchor="introduction.of.content-encoding">
<t>
   RFC 2045 does not include any concept equivalent to HTTP/1.1's
   Content-Encoding header field. Since this acts as a modifier on the
   media type, proxies and gateways from HTTP to MIME-compliant
   protocols &MUST; either change the value of the Content-Type header
   field or decode the entity-body before forwarding the message. (Some
   experimental applications of Content-Type for Internet mail have used
   a media-type parameter of ";conversions=&lt;content-coding&gt;" to perform
   a function equivalent to Content-Encoding. However, this parameter is
   not part of RFC 2045).
</t>
</section>

<section title="No Content-Transfer-Encoding" anchor="no.content-transfer-encoding">
<t>
   HTTP does not use the Content-Transfer-Encoding (CTE) field of RFC
   2045. Proxies and gateways from MIME-compliant protocols to HTTP &MUST;
   remove any non-identity CTE ("quoted-printable" or "base64") encoding
   prior to delivering the response message to an HTTP client.
</t>
<t>
   Proxies and gateways from HTTP to MIME-compliant protocols are
   responsible for ensuring that the message is in the correct format
   and encoding for safe transport on that protocol, where "safe
   transport" is defined by the limitations of the protocol being used.
   Such a proxy or gateway &SHOULD; label the data with an appropriate
   Content-Transfer-Encoding if doing so will improve the likelihood of
   safe transport over the destination protocol.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Introduction of Transfer-Encoding" anchor="introduction.of.transfer-encoding">
<t>
   HTTP/1.1 introduces the Transfer-Encoding header field (<xref target="header.transfer-encoding"/>).
   Proxies/gateways &MUST; remove any transfer-coding prior to

<section title="MHTML and Line Length Limitations" anchor="mhtml.line.length">
<t>
   HTTP implementations which share code with MHTML <xref target="RFC2110"/> implementations
   need to be aware of MIME line length limitations. Since HTTP does not
   have this limitation, HTTP does not fold long lines. MHTML messages
   being transported by HTTP follow all conventions of MHTML, including
   line length limitations and folding, canonicalization, etc., since
   HTTP transports all message-bodies as payload (see <xref target="multipart.types"/>) and
   does not interpret the content or any MIME header lines that might be
   contained therein.
</t>
</section>
</section>

<section title="Additional Features" anchor="additional.features">
<t>
   RFC 1945 and RFC 2068 document protocol elements used by some
   existing HTTP implementations, but not consistently and correctly
   across most HTTP/1.1 applications. Implementors are advised to be
   aware of these features, but cannot rely upon their presence in, or
   interoperability with, other HTTP/1.1 applications. Some of these
   describe proposed experimental features, and some describe features
   that experimental deployment found lacking that are now addressed in
   the base HTTP/1.1 specification.
</t>
<t>
   A number of other headers, such as Content-Disposition and Title,
   from SMTP and MIME are also often implemented (see RFC 2076 <xref target="RFC2076"/>).
</t>

<section title="Content-Disposition" anchor="content-disposition">
<iref item="Headers" subitem="Content-Disposition" primary="true" x:for-anchor=""/>
<iref item="Content-Disposition header" primary="true" x:for-anchor=""/>
<t>
   The Content-Disposition response-header field has been proposed as a
   means for the origin server to suggest a default filename if the user
   requests that the content is saved to a file. This usage is derived
   from the definition of Content-Disposition in RFC 1806 <xref target="RFC1806"/>.

   An example is
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">

</artwork></figure>
<t>
   The receiving user agent &SHOULD-NOT;  respect any directory path
   information present in the filename-parm parameter, which is the only
   parameter believed to apply to HTTP implementations at this time. The
   filename &SHOULD; be treated as a terminal component only.
</t>
<t>
   If this header is used in a response with the application/octet-stream
   content-type, the implied suggestion is that the user agent
   should not display the response, but directly enter a `save response

<section title="Compatibility with Previous Versions" anchor="compatibility">
<t>
   It is beyond the scope of a protocol specification to mandate
   compliance with previous versions. HTTP/1.1 was deliberately
   designed, however, to make supporting previous versions easy. It is
   worth noting that, at the time of composing this specification
   (1996), we would expect commercial HTTP/1.1 servers to:
  <list style="symbols">
     <t>recognize the format of the Request-Line for HTTP/0.9, 1.0, and
        1.1 requests;</t>

     <t>understand any valid request in the format of HTTP/0.9, 1.0, or
        1.1;</t>

     <t>respond appropriately with a message in the same major version
        used by the client.</t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   And we would expect HTTP/1.1 clients to:
  <list style="symbols">
     <t>recognize the format of the Status-Line for HTTP/1.0 and 1.1
        responses;</t>

     <t>understand any valid response in the format of HTTP/0.9, 1.0, or
        1.1.</t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   For most implementations of HTTP/1.0, each connection is established
   by the client prior to the request and closed by the server after
   sending the response. Some implementations implement the Keep-Alive
   version of persistent connections described in <xref x:sec="19.7.1" x:fmt="sec" target="RFC2068"/> of RFC
   2068 <xref target="RFC2068"/>.
</t>

<section title="Changes from HTTP/1.0" anchor="changes.from.1.0">
<t>
   This section summarizes major differences between versions HTTP/1.0
   and HTTP/1.1.
</t>

<section title="Changes to Simplify Multi-homed Web Servers and Conserve IP Addresses" anchor="changes.to.simplify.multi-homed.web.servers.and.conserve.ip.addresses">
<t>
   The requirements that clients and servers support the Host request-header,
   report an error if the Host request-header (<xref target="header.host"/>) is
   missing from an HTTP/1.1 request, and accept absolute URIs (<xref target="request-uri"/>)
   are among the most important changes defined by this
   specification.
</t>
<t>
   Older HTTP/1.0 clients assumed a one-to-one relationship of IP
   addresses and servers; there was no other established mechanism for
   distinguishing the intended server of a request than the IP address
   to which that request was directed. The changes outlined above will
   allow the Internet, once older HTTP clients are no longer common, to
   support multiple Web sites from a single IP address, greatly
   simplifying large operational Web servers, where allocation of many
   IP addresses to a single host has created serious problems. The
   Internet will also be able to recover the IP addresses that have been
   allocated for the sole purpose of allowing special-purpose domain
   names to be used in root-level HTTP URLs. Given the rate of growth of
   the Web, and the number of servers already deployed, it is extremely
   important that all implementations of HTTP (including updates to
   existing HTTP/1.0 applications) correctly implement these
   requirements:
  <list style="symbols">
     <t>Both clients and servers &MUST; support the Host request-header.</t>

     <t>A client that sends an HTTP/1.1 request &MUST; send a Host header.</t>

     <t>Servers &MUST; report a <x:ref>400 (Bad Request)</x:ref> error if an HTTP/1.1
        request does not include a Host request-header.</t>

     <t>Servers &MUST; accept absolute URIs.</t>
  </list>
</t>
</section>
</section>

<section title="Compatibility with HTTP/1.0 Persistent Connections" anchor="compatibility.with.http.1.0.persistent.connections">
<t>
   Some clients and servers might wish to be compatible with some
   previous implementations of persistent connections in HTTP/1.0
   clients and servers. Persistent connections in HTTP/1.0 are
   explicitly negotiated as they are not the default behavior. HTTP/1.0
   experimental implementations of persistent connections are faulty,
   and the new facilities in HTTP/1.1 are designed to rectify these
   problems. The problem was that some existing 1.0 clients may be
   sending Keep-Alive to a proxy server that doesn't understand
   Connection, which would then erroneously forward it to the next
   inbound server, which would establish the Keep-Alive connection and
   result in a hung HTTP/1.0 proxy waiting for the close on the
   response. The result is that HTTP/1.0 clients must be prevented from
   using Keep-Alive when talking to proxies.
</t>
<t>
   However, talking to proxies is the most important use of persistent
   connections, so that prohibition is clearly unacceptable. Therefore,
   we need some other mechanism for indicating a persistent connection
   is desired, which is safe to use even when talking to an old proxy
   that ignores Connection. Persistent connections are the default for
   HTTP/1.1 messages; we introduce a new keyword (Connection: close) for
   declaring non-persistence. See <xref target="header.connection"/>.
</t>
<t>
   The original HTTP/1.0 form of persistent connections (the Connection:
   Keep-Alive and Keep-Alive header) is documented in RFC 2068. <xref target="RFC2068"/>
</t>
</section>

<section title="Changes from RFC 2068" anchor="changes.from.rfc.2068">
<t>
   This specification has been carefully audited to correct and
   disambiguate key word usage; RFC 2068 had many problems in respect to
   the conventions laid out in RFC 2119 <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
</t>
<t>
   Clarified which error code should be used for inbound server failures
   (e.g. DNS failures). (<xref target="status.504"/>).
</t>
<t>
   CREATE had a race that required an Etag be sent when a resource is
   first created. (<xref target="status.201"/>).
</t>
<t>
   Content-Base was deleted from the specification: it was not
   implemented widely, and there is no simple, safe way to introduce it
   without a robust extension mechanism. In addition, it is used in a
   similar, but not identical fashion in MHTML <xref target="RFC2110"/>.
</t>
<t>
   Transfer-coding and message lengths all interact in ways that
   required fixing exactly when chunked encoding is used (to allow for
   transfer encoding that may not be self delimiting); it was important
   to straighten out exactly how message lengths are computed. (Sections
   <xref target="transfer.codings" format="counter"/>, <xref target="message.length" format="counter"/>,
   <xref target="entity.length" format="counter"/>, <xref target="non-modifiable.headers" format="counter"/>,
   <xref target="header.content-length" format="counter"/>, <xref target="header.content-range" format="counter"/>)
</t>
<t>
   A content-coding of "identity" was introduced, to solve problems
   discovered in caching. (<xref target="content.codings"/>)
</t>
<t>
   Quality Values of zero should indicate that "I don't want something"
   to allow clients to refuse a representation. (<xref target="quality.values"/>)
</t>
<t>
   The use and interpretation of HTTP version numbers has been clarified
   by RFC 2145. Require proxies to upgrade requests to highest protocol
   version they support to deal with problems discovered in HTTP/1.0
   implementations (<xref target="http.version"/>)
</t>
<t>
   Charset wildcarding is introduced to avoid explosion of character set
   names in accept headers. (<xref target="header.accept-charset"/>)
</t>
<t>
   A case was missed in the Cache-Control model of HTTP/1.1; s-maxage
   was introduced to add this missing case. (Sections <xref target="response.cacheability" format="counter"/>,
   <xref target="header.authorization" format="counter"/>,
   <xref target="header.cache-control" format="counter"/>,
   <xref target="modifications.of.the.basic.expiration.mechanism" format="counter"/>)
</t>
<t>
   The Cache-Control: max-age directive was not properly defined for
   responses. (<xref target="modifications.of.the.basic.expiration.mechanism"/>)
</t>
<t>
   There are situations where a server (especially a proxy) does not
   know the full length of a response but is capable of serving a
   byterange request. We therefore need a mechanism to allow byteranges
   with a content-range not indicating the full length of the message.
   (<xref target="header.content-range"/>)
</t>
<t>
   Range request responses would become very verbose if all meta-data
   were always returned; by allowing the server to only send needed
   headers in a 206 response, this problem can be avoided. (Section
   <xref target="status.206" format="counter"/>, <xref target="combining.headers" format="counter"/>,
   and <xref target="header.if-range" format="counter"/>)
</t>
<t>
   Fix problem with unsatisfiable range requests; there are two cases:
   syntactic problems, and range doesn't exist in the document. The 416
   status code was needed to resolve this ambiguity needed to indicate
   an error for a byte range request that falls outside of the actual
   contents of a document. (Section <xref target="status.416" format="counter"/>, <xref target="header.content-range" format="counter"/>)
</t>
<t>
   Rewrite of message transmission requirements to make it much harder
   for implementors to get it wrong, as the consequences of errors here
   can have significant impact on the Internet, and to deal with the
   following problems:
  <list style="numbers">
      <t>Changing "HTTP/1.1 or later" to "HTTP/1.1", in contexts where
         this was incorrectly placing a requirement on the behavior of
         an implementation of a future version of HTTP/1.x</t>

      <t>Made it clear that user-agents should retry requests, not
         "clients" in general.</t>

      <t>Converted requirements for clients to ignore unexpected 100
         (Continue) responses, and for proxies to forward 100 responses,
         into a general requirement for 1xx responses.</t>

      <t>Modified some TCP-specific language, to make it clearer that
         non-TCP transports are possible for HTTP.</t>

      <t>Require that the origin server &MUST-NOT; wait for the request
         body before it sends a required <x:ref>100 (Continue)</x:ref> response.</t>

      <t>Allow, rather than require, a server to omit <x:ref>100 (Continue)</x:ref> if
         it has already seen some of the request body.</t>

      <t>Allow servers to defend against denial-of-service attacks and
         broken clients.</t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   This change adds the Expect header and 417 status code. The message
   transmission requirements fixes are in sections <xref target="message.transmission.requirements" format="counter"/>,
   <xref target="status.417" format="counter"/>,
   <xref target="pipelining" format="counter"/>,
   <xref target="write-through.mandatory" format="counter"/>,
   and <xref target="header.expect" format="counter"/>.
</t>
<t>
   Proxies should be able to add Content-Length when appropriate.
   (<xref target="non-modifiable.headers"/>)
</t>
<t>
   Clean up confusion between 403 and 404 responses. (Section <xref target="status.403" format="counter"/>,
   <xref target="status.404" format="counter"/>, and <xref target="status.410" format="counter"/>)
</t>
<t>
   Warnings could be cached incorrectly, or not updated appropriately.
   (Section <xref target="warnings" format="counter"/>, <xref target="expiration.calculations" format="counter"/>, <xref target="non-modifiable.headers" format="counter"/>,
   <xref target="combining.headers" format="counter"/>, <xref target="modifications.of.the.basic.expiration.mechanism" format="counter"/>,
   and <xref target="header.warning" format="counter"/>) Warning
   also needed to be a general header, as PUT or other methods may have
   need for it in requests.
</t>
<t>
   Transfer-coding had significant problems, particularly with
   interactions with chunked encoding. The solution is that transfer-codings
   become as full fledged as content-codings. This involves
   adding an IANA registry for transfer-codings (separate from content
   codings), a new header field (TE) and enabling trailer headers in the
   future. Transfer encoding is a major performance benefit, so it was
   worth fixing <xref target="Nie1997"/>. TE also solves another, obscure, downward
   interoperability problem that could have occurred due to interactions
   between authentication trailers, chunked encoding and HTTP/1.0
   clients.(Section <xref target="transfer.codings" format="counter"/>, <xref target="chunked.transfer.encoding" format="counter"/>,
   and <xref target="header.te" format="counter"/>)
