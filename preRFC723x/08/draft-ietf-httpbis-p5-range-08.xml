<abstract>
<t>
   The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level
   protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information
   systems. HTTP has been in use by the World Wide Web global information
   initiative since 1990. This document is Part 5 of the seven-part specification
   that defines the protocol referred to as "HTTP/1.1" and, taken together,
   obsoletes RFC 2616.  Part 5 defines range-specific requests and
   the rules for constructing and combining responses to those requests.
</t>
</abstract>

<note title="Editorial Note (To be removed by RFC Editor)">

    Discussion of this draft should take place on the HTTPBIS working group
    mailing list (ietf-http-wg@w3.org). The current issues list is
    at <eref target="http://tools.ietf.org/wg/httpbis/trac/report/11"/>
    and related documents (including fancy diffs) can be found at
    <eref target="http://tools.ietf.org/wg/httpbis/"/>.

<section title="Introduction" anchor="introduction">
<t>
   HTTP clients often encounter interrupted data transfers as a result
   of cancelled requests or dropped connections.  When a cache has stored
   a partial representation, it is desirable to request the remainder
   of that representation in a subsequent request rather than transfer
   the entire representation.
   There are also a number of Web applications that benefit from being
   able to request only a subset of a larger representation, such as a
   single page of a very large document or only part of an image to be
   rendered by a device with limited local storage.
</t>
<t>
   This document defines HTTP/1.1 range requests,
   partial responses, and the multipart/byteranges media type.
   The protocol for range requests is an OPTIONAL feature of HTTP,
   designed so resources or recipients that do not implement this feature
   can respond as if it is a normal GET request without impacting
   interoperability.  Partial responses are indicated by a distinct status
   code to not be mistaken for full responses by intermediate caches
   that might not implement the feature.
</t>
<t>
   Although the HTTP range request mechanism is designed to allow for
   extensible range types, this specification only defines requests for
   byte ranges.
</t>

<section title="Requirements" anchor="intro.requirements">
<t>
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
</t>
<t>
   An implementation is not compliant if it fails to satisfy one or more
   of the MUST or REQUIRED level requirements for the protocols it
   implements. An implementation that satisfies all the MUST or REQUIRED
   level and all the SHOULD level requirements for its protocols is said
   to be "unconditionally compliant"; one that satisfies all the MUST
   level requirements but not all the SHOULD level requirements for its
   protocols is said to be "conditionally compliant."
</t>
</section>

<section title="Syntax Notation" anchor="notation">
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
<t>
  This specification uses the ABNF syntax defined in Section 1.2 of <xref target="Part1"/> (which
  extends the syntax defined in <xref target="RFC5234"/> with a list rule).
  <xref target="collected.abnf"/> shows the collected ABNF, with the list
  rule expanded.
</t>
<t>
  The following core rules are included by
  reference, as defined in <xref target="RFC5234"/>, Appendix B.1:
  ALPHA (letters), CR (carriage return), CRLF (CR LF), CTL (controls),
  DIGIT (decimal 0-9), DQUOTE (double quote),
  HEXDIG (hexadecimal 0-9/A-F/a-f), LF (line feed),
  OCTET (any 8-bit sequence of data), SP (space),
  VCHAR (any visible USASCII character),
  and WSP (whitespace).
</t>

<section title="Core Rules" anchor="core.rules">
  
  
<t>
  The core rules below are defined in Section 1.2.2 of <xref target="Part1"/>:

<section title="Range Units" anchor="range.units">
  
  
  
<t>
   HTTP/1.1 allows a client to request that only part (a range of) the
   response entity be included within the response. HTTP/1.1 uses range
   units in the Range (<xref target="header.range"/>) and Content-Range (<xref target="header.content-range"/>)
   header fields. An entity can be broken down into subranges according
   to various structural units.
</t>
<figure><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="range-unit"/><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="bytes-unit"/><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="other-range-unit"/><artwork type="abnf2616"><![CDATA[
  range-unit       = bytes-unit / other-range-unit
  bytes-unit       = "bytes"
  other-range-unit = token
]]></artwork></figure>
<t>
  HTTP/1.1 has been designed to allow implementations of applications
  that do not depend on knowledge of ranges. The only range unit defined
  by HTTP/1.1 is "bytes".
</t>
<t>
  If a range unit is not understood in a request, a server MUST ignore
  the whole Range header (<xref target="header.range"/>).
  If a range unit is not understood in a response, an intermediary 
  SHOULD pass the response to the client; a client MUST fail.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Status Code Definitions">
<section title="206 Partial Content" anchor="status.206">
  <iref primary="true" item="206 Partial Content (status code)"/>
  <iref primary="true" item="Status Codes" subitem="206 Partial Content"/>
<t>
   The server has fulfilled the partial GET request for the resource.
   The request MUST have included a Range header field (<xref target="header.range"/>)
   indicating the desired range, and MAY have included an If-Range
   header field (<xref target="header.if-range"/>) to make the request conditional.
</t>
<t>
   The response MUST include the following header fields:
  <list style="symbols">
    <t>
        Either a Content-Range header field (<xref target="header.content-range"/>) indicating
        the range included with this response, or a multipart/byteranges
        Content-Type including Content-Range fields for each part. If a
        Content-Length header field is present in the response, its
        value MUST match the actual number of OCTETs transmitted in the
        message-body.
    </t>
    <t>
        Date
    </t>
    <t>
        ETag and/or Content-Location, if the header would have been sent
        in a 200 response to the same request
    </t>
    <t>
        Expires, Cache-Control, and/or Vary, if the field-value might
        differ from that sent in any previous response for the same
        variant
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   If the 206 response is the result of an If-Range request, the response
   SHOULD NOT include other entity-headers. Otherwise, the response
   MUST include all of the entity-headers that would have been returned
   with a 200 (OK) response to the same request.
</t>
<t>
   A cache MUST NOT combine a 206 response with other previously cached
   content if the ETag or Last-Modified headers do not match exactly,
   see <xref target="combining.byte.ranges"/>.
</t>
<t>
   A cache that does not support the Range and Content-Range headers
   MUST NOT cache 206 (Partial Content) responses. Furthermore,
   if a response uses a range unit that is not understood by the cache,
   then it MUST NOT be cached either. 
</t>
</section>

<section title="416 Requested Range Not Satisfiable" anchor="status.416">
  <iref primary="true" item="416 Requested Range Not Satisfiable (status code)"/>
  <iref primary="true" item="Status Codes" subitem="416 Requested Range Not Satisfiable"/>
<t>
   A server SHOULD return a response with this status code if a request
   included a Range request-header field (<xref target="header.range"/>), and none of
   the ranges-specifier values in this field overlap the current extent
   of the selected resource, and the request did not include an If-Range
   request-header field. (For byte-ranges, this means that the first-byte-pos
   of all of the byte-range-spec values were greater than the
   current length of the selected resource.)
</t>
<t>
   When this status code is returned for a byte-range request, the
   response SHOULD include a Content-Range entity-header field
   specifying the current length of the selected resource (see <xref target="header.content-range"/>).
   This response MUST NOT use the multipart/byteranges content-type.
</t>
</section>
</section>

<section title="Combining Ranges" anchor="combining.byte.ranges">
<t>
   A response might transfer only a subrange of an entity-body, either 
   the request included one or more Range specifications, or because 
   a connection was broken prematurely.
   After several such transfers, a cache might have received several 
   ranges of the same entity-body.
</t>
<t>
   If a cache has a stored non-empty set of subranges for an entity, and
   an incoming response transfers another subrange, the cache MAY
   combine the new subrange with the existing set if both the following
   conditions are met:
  <list style="symbols">
    <t>Both the incoming response and the cache entry have a cache
        validator.</t>
    <t>The two cache validators match using the strong comparison
        function (see Section 4 of <xref target="Part4"/>).</t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   If either requirement is not met, the cache MUST use only the most
   recent partial response (based on the Date values transmitted with
   every response, and using the incoming response if these values are
   equal or missing), and MUST discard the other partial information.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Header Field Definitions" anchor="header.fields">
<t>
   This section defines the syntax and semantics of HTTP/1.1 header fields
   related to range requests and partial responses.
</t>
<t>
   For entity-header fields, both sender and recipient refer to either the
   client or the server, depending on who sends and who receives the entity.
</t>

<section title="Accept-Ranges" anchor="header.accept-ranges">
  <iref primary="true" item="Accept-Ranges header"/>
  <iref primary="true" item="Headers" subitem="Accept-Ranges"/>
  
  
  
<t>
   The "Accept-Ranges" response-header field allows a resource to indicate
   its acceptance of range requests.

      but are not required to do so. Clients MAY generate range
      requests without having received this header for the resource
      involved. Range units are defined in <xref target="range.units"/>.
</t>
<t>
      Servers that do not accept any kind of range request for a
      resource MAY send
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example"><![CDATA[

  <iref primary="true" item="Headers" subitem="Content-Range"/>
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
<t>
   The "Content-Range" entity-header field is sent with a partial entity-body to
   specify where in the full entity-body the partial body should be
   applied. Range units are defined in <xref target="range.units"/>.
</t>

  Content-Range-v = content-range-spec

                            byte-range-resp-spec "/"

  byte-range-resp-spec    = (first-byte-pos "-" last-byte-pos)
                          / "*"
                          
  instance-length         = 1*DIGIT

]]></artwork></figure>
<t>
   The header SHOULD indicate the total length of the full entity-body,
   unless this length is unknown or difficult to determine. The asterisk
   "*" character means that the instance-length is unknown at the time
   when the response was generated.
</t>
<t>
   Unlike byte-ranges-specifier values (see <xref target="byte.ranges"/>), a byte-range-resp-spec
   MUST only specify one range, and MUST contain
   absolute byte positions for both the first and last byte of the
   range.
</t>
<t>
   A byte-content-range-spec with a byte-range-resp-spec whose last-byte-pos
   value is less than its first-byte-pos value, or whose
   instance-length value is less than or equal to its last-byte-pos
   value, is invalid. The recipient of an invalid byte-content-range-spec
   MUST ignore it and any content transferred along with it.
</t>
<t>
   In the case of a byte range request:
   A server sending a response with status code 416 (Requested range not
   satisfiable) SHOULD include a Content-Range field with a byte-range-resp-spec
   of "*". The instance-length specifies the current length of
   the selected resource. A response with status code 206 (Partial
   Content) MUST NOT include a Content-Range field with a byte-range-resp-spec of "*".
</t>
<t>
   Examples of byte-content-range-spec values, assuming that the entity
   contains a total of 1234 bytes:
   <list style="symbols">
      <t>
        The first 500 bytes:
<figure><artwork type="example"><![CDATA[
     bytes 0-499/1234
   ]]></artwork></figure>
      </t>    
      <t>
        The second 500 bytes:
<figure><artwork type="example"><![CDATA[
     bytes 500-999/1234
   ]]></artwork></figure>
      </t>    
      <t>
        All except for the first 500 bytes:
<figure><artwork type="example"><![CDATA[
     bytes 500-1233/1234
   ]]></artwork></figure>
      </t>    
      <t>
        The last 500 bytes:
<figure><artwork type="example"><![CDATA[
     bytes 734-1233/1234
   ]]></artwork></figure>
      </t>    
   </list>
</t>
<t>
   When an HTTP message includes the content of a single range (for
   example, a response to a request for a single range, or to a request
   for a set of ranges that overlap without any holes), this content is
   transmitted with a Content-Range header, and a Content-Length header
   showing the number of bytes actually transferred. For example,
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example"><![CDATA[
  HTTP/1.1 206 Partial Content
  Date: Wed, 15 Nov 1995 06:25:24 GMT
  Last-Modified: Wed, 15 Nov 1995 04:58:08 GMT
  Content-Range: bytes 21010-47021/47022
  Content-Length: 26012
  Content-Type: image/gif
]]></artwork></figure>
<t>
   When an HTTP message includes the content of multiple ranges (for
   example, a response to a request for multiple non-overlapping
   ranges), these are transmitted as a multipart message. The multipart
   media type used for this purpose is "multipart/byteranges" as defined
   in <xref target="internet.media.type.multipart.byteranges"/>. See <xref target="changes.from.rfc.2068"/> for a compatibility issue.
</t>
<t>
   A response to a request for a single range MUST NOT be sent using the
   multipart/byteranges media type.  A response to a request for
   multiple ranges, whose result is a single range, MAY be sent as a
   multipart/byteranges media type with one part. A client that cannot
   decode a multipart/byteranges message MUST NOT ask for multiple
   ranges in a single request.
</t>
<t>
   When a client requests multiple ranges in one request, the
   server SHOULD return them in the order that they appeared in the
   request.
</t>
<t>
   If the server ignores a byte-range-spec because it is syntactically
   invalid, the server SHOULD treat the request as if the invalid Range
   header field did not exist. (Normally, this means return a 200
   response containing the full entity).
</t>
<t>
   If the server receives a request (other than one including an If-Range
   request-header field) with an unsatisfiable Range request-header
   field (that is, all of whose byte-range-spec values have a
   first-byte-pos value greater than the current length of the selected
   resource), it SHOULD return a response code of 416 (Requested range
   not satisfiable) (<xref target="status.416"/>).
</t>
<t><list>
  <t>
    Note: clients cannot depend on servers to send a 416 (Requested
    range not satisfiable) response instead of a 200 (OK) response for
    an unsatisfiable Range request-header, since not all servers
    implement this request-header.

   If a client has a partial copy of an entity in its cache, and wishes
   to have an up-to-date copy of the entire entity in its cache, it
   could use the Range request-header with a conditional GET (using
   either or both of If-Unmodified-Since and If-Match.) However, if the
   condition fails because the entity has been modified, the client
   would then have to make a second request to obtain the entire current
   entity-body.
</t>
<t>
   The "If-Range" request-header field allows a client to "short-circuit" the second
   request. Informally, its meaning is `if the entity is unchanged, send
   me the part(s) that I am missing; otherwise, send me the entire new
   entity'.

]]></artwork></figure>
<t>
   If the client has no entity tag for an entity, but does have a Last-Modified
   date, it MAY use that date in an If-Range header. (The
   server can distinguish between a valid HTTP-date and any form of
   entity-tag by examining no more than two characters.) The If-Range
   header SHOULD only be used together with a Range header, and MUST be
   ignored if the request does not include a Range header, or if the
   server does not support the sub-range operation.
</t>
<t>
   If the entity tag given in the If-Range header matches the current
   cache validator for the entity, then the server SHOULD provide the
   specified sub-range of the entity using a 206 (Partial Content)
   response. If the cache validator does not match, then the server SHOULD
   return the entire entity using a 200 (OK) response.

<t>
   Since all HTTP entities are represented in HTTP messages as sequences
   of bytes, the concept of a byte range is meaningful for any HTTP
   entity. (However, not all clients and servers need to support byte-range
   operations.)
</t>
<t>
   Byte range specifications in HTTP apply to the sequence of bytes in
   the entity-body (not necessarily the same as the message-body).
</t>
<t anchor="rule.ranges-specifier">
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

   A byte range operation MAY specify a single range of bytes, or a set
   of ranges within a single entity.
</t>

  first-byte-pos  = 1*DIGIT
  last-byte-pos   = 1*DIGIT
]]></artwork></figure>
<t>
   The first-byte-pos value in a byte-range-spec gives the byte-offset
   of the first byte in a range. The last-byte-pos value gives the
   byte-offset of the last byte in the range; that is, the byte
   positions specified are inclusive. Byte offsets start at zero.
</t>
<t>
   If the last-byte-pos value is present, it MUST be greater than or
   equal to the first-byte-pos in that byte-range-spec, or the byte-range-spec
   is syntactically invalid. The recipient of a byte-range-set
   that includes one or more syntactically invalid byte-range-spec
   values MUST ignore the header field that includes that byte-range-set.
</t>
<t>
   If the last-byte-pos value is absent, or if the value is greater than
   or equal to the current length of the entity-body, last-byte-pos is
   taken to be equal to one less than the current length of the entity-body
   in bytes.
</t>
<t>
   By its choice of last-byte-pos, a client can limit the number of
   bytes retrieved without knowing the size of the entity.
</t>

  suffix-byte-range-spec = "-" suffix-length
  suffix-length = 1*DIGIT
]]></artwork></figure>
<t>
   A suffix-byte-range-spec is used to specify the suffix of the
   entity-body, of a length given by the suffix-length value. (That is,
   this form specifies the last N bytes of an entity-body.) If the
   entity is shorter than the specified suffix-length, the entire
   entity-body is used.
</t>
<t>
   If a syntactically valid byte-range-set includes at least one byte-range-spec
   whose first-byte-pos is less than the current length of
   the entity-body, or at least one suffix-byte-range-spec with a non-zero
   suffix-length, then the byte-range-set is satisfiable.
   Otherwise, the byte-range-set is unsatisfiable. If the byte-range-set
   is unsatisfiable, the server SHOULD return a response with a status
   of 416 (Requested range not satisfiable). Otherwise, the server
   SHOULD return a response with a status of 206 (Partial Content)
   containing the satisfiable ranges of the entity-body.

<section title="Range Retrieval Requests" anchor="range.retrieval.requests">
  
  
  
  
<t>
   The "Range" request-header field defines the GET method (conditional or
   not) to request one or more sub-ranges of the response entity-body, instead
   of the entire entity body.
</t>
<figure><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="Range"/><artwork type="abnf2616"><![CDATA[
  Range   = "Range" ":" OWS Range-v
  Range-v = byte-ranges-specifier
          / other-ranges-specifier
  other-ranges-specifier = other-range-unit "=" other-range-set
  other-range-set = 1*CHAR
]]></artwork></figure>
<t>
   A server MAY ignore the Range header. However, HTTP/1.1 origin
   servers and intermediate caches ought to support byte ranges when
   possible, since Range supports efficient recovery from partially
   failed transfers, and supports efficient partial retrieval of large
   entities.
</t>
<t>
   If the server supports the Range header and the specified range or
   ranges are appropriate for the entity:
  <list style="symbols">
     <t>The presence of a Range header in an unconditional GET modifies
        what is returned if the GET is otherwise successful. In other
        words, the response carries a status code of 206 (Partial
        Content) instead of 200 (OK).</t>

     <t>The presence of a Range header in a conditional GET (a request
        using one or both of If-Modified-Since and If-None-Match, or
        one or both of If-Unmodified-Since and If-Match) modifies what
        is returned if the GET is otherwise successful and the
        condition is true. It does not affect the 304 (Not Modified)
        response returned if the conditional is false.</t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   In some cases, it might be more appropriate to use the If-Range
   header (see <xref target="header.if-range"/>) in addition to the Range header.
</t>
<t>
   If a proxy that supports ranges receives a Range request, forwards
   the request to an inbound server, and receives an entire entity in
   reply, it SHOULD only return the requested range to its client. It
   SHOULD store the entire received response in its cache if that is
   consistent with its cache allocation policies.

   When an HTTP 206 (Partial Content) response message includes the
   content of multiple ranges (a response to a request for multiple
   non-overlapping ranges), these are transmitted as a multipart
   message-body (<xref target="RFC2046"/>, Section 5.1). The media type for this purpose is called
   "multipart/byteranges".  The following is to be registered with IANA <xref target="RFC4288"/>.
</t>
<t><list>
  <t>
    Note: Despite the name "multipart/byteranges" is not limited to the byte ranges only.
  </t>
</list></t>
<t>
   The multipart/byteranges media type includes one or more parts, each
   with its own Content-Type and Content-Range fields. The required
   boundary parameter specifies the boundary string used to separate
   each body-part.

      <t>A number of browsers and servers were coded to an early draft

<section title="Changes from RFC 2068" anchor="changes.from.rfc.2068">
<t>
   Transfer-coding and message lengths all interact in ways that
   required fixing exactly when chunked encoding is used (to allow for
   transfer encoding that may not be self delimiting); it was important
   to straighten out exactly how message lengths are computed.
   (<xref target="header.content-range"/>,
   see also <xref target="Part1"/>, <xref target="Part3"/> and <xref target="Part6"/>)
</t>
<t>
   There are situations where a server (especially a proxy) does not
   know the full length of a response but is capable of serving a
   byterange request. We therefore need a mechanism to allow byteranges
   with a content-range not indicating the full length of the message.
   (<xref target="header.content-range"/>)
</t>
<t>
   Range request responses would become very verbose if all meta-data
   were always returned; by allowing the server to only send needed
   headers in a 206 response, this problem can be avoided.
   (Section <xref target="status.206" format="counter"/>
   and <xref target="header.if-range" format="counter"/>)
</t>
<t>
   Fix problem with unsatisfiable range requests; there are two cases:
   syntactic problems, and range doesn't exist in the document. The 416
   status code was needed to resolve this ambiguity needed to indicate
   an error for a byte range request that falls outside of the actual
   contents of a document. (Section <xref target="status.416" format="counter"/>, <xref target="header.content-range" format="counter"/>)
